<h1>A brief history of Pawn</h1>

<p>
	For recent version history, see the <a href="Readme.htm">Pawn readme</a>. 
	(I got tired of the version history section of the <a href="Readme.htm">
	readme</a> being longer than the rest of it, so I moved parts here.)</p>
<h3>Version 2.6.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: The individual schools of spell damage 
	(of Fiery Wrath, etc.) will now show up on the Weights tab like they did in 
	Classic Era and Burning Crusade Classic, though those stats are no longer 
	found on Northrend items.</li>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Added a new version of the default 
	protection paladin stat weights with some small adjustments to optimize for 
	threat generation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.6.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Fixed Pawn's gem recommendations for 
	Burning Crusade items on the Wrath pre-patch. (The Northrend gem 
	recommendations were correct, but the Outland gems were still being 
	recommended based on their old stats from Burning Crusade.)</li>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Added support for ranged attack power on 
	more types of items in all languages.</li>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Added support for spell power on items 
	"of Sorcery" in French and Latin American Spanish.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.6.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The list of scales will now display a warning at the top if you don't 
	have any scales visible. (Most of Pawn's features don't do anything if no 
	scales are visible, but it's okay to ignore the warning if that's what you 
	really want.)</li>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: The first time you log in on a death 
	knight after updating, Pawn will re-show all of the death knight starter 
	scales if you don't have any custom scales shown.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.6.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Ranged attack power will now show up in 
	the list of stat weights and on the Compare tab again.</li>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Added support for armor penetration and 
	expertise on more types of items in all languages.</li>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Added support for attack power on more 
	types of items in European Spanish, Latin American Spanish, and Traditional 
	Chinese.</li>
	<li>Includes Russian translation updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.6.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Fixed a problem that started occurring 
	after the latest Wrath update that caused Pawn to sometimes stop annotating 
	tooltips for a while after you changed anything about your current scales 
	(changing visibility, changing stat weights, etc.).</li>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Fixed a problem where some specs were 
	getting hit, crit, and haste ratings of 1 instead of 0 or a fraction as 
	intended.</li>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Fixed a typo that caused the default 
	spell power weight for discipline priests to be 100⨉ what it was intended to 
	be. Oops.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.6.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: The death knight starter scales now 
	indicate in the name whether they're providing advice for tanking or DPS.</li>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Feral attack power now works as it did 
	in Pawn 1.1 back when Wrath was new—it's not a real stat on items in Wrath, 
	but it appears on tooltips when playing a druid. A value you assign to feral 
	attack power will work the same as if it were a real stat, like before the 
	pre-patch. You can assign points to melee weapon DPS or feral attack power, 
	but you probably don't want to assign points to both.</li>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Fixed a problem where weapon DPS was 
	contributing more to an item's score than intended when using the default 
	stat weights.</li>
	<li>Traditional Chinese Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Pawn now supports 
	Wrath Classic (including the pre-patch) in Traditional Chinese.</li>
	<li>German Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Includes a minor translation 
	update.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.6.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Wrath of the Lich King Classic pre-patch: Today's Wrath Classic patch 
	broke addons that need to detect which version of the game you're playing, 
	including Pawn. This version of Pawn should work correctly again after that 
	change.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.6</h3>
<p>This version introduces support for the Wrath of the Lich King Classic 
pre-patch.</p>
<ul>
	<li>There are all-new default stat weights for all classes and specs, 
	including death knights, curated by HawsJon (thanks!). These should provide 
	more accurate advice for level 80 and the mechanics changes in the 
	pre-patch.<ul>
		<li>As always, simulating your character and maintaining custom stat 
		weights will yield even better advice, specifically tailored for your 
		character.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Spell damage and spell healing have been converted into a single stat, 
	spell power. Existing custom scales will be converted automatically by 
	choosing the better of the two weights, and then you can continue to adjust 
	as needed.</li>
	<li>Hit, crit, and haste have been converted from individual melee and spell 
	ratings to a single rating each. Existing custom scales will be converted 
	automatically by choosing the better of the two weights, and then you can 
	continue to adjust as needed.</li>
	<li>Pawn now includes data for the Wrath of the Lich King Classic gems, but 
	it won't start suggesting those gems until you start getting Northrend gear. 
	You can still browse them on the Gems tab.</li>
	<li>There is currently no way to distinguish between armor and bonus 
	armor—sorry, bear tanks.</li>
	<li>This version of Pawn will not work properly in Traditional 
	Chinese on Wrath Classic due to an updated translation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This version also includes minor fixes for Shadowlands, Classic Era, and The 
Burning Crusade.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Shadowlands: Added Pawn annotations to the tooltips for converted items 
	at the Creation Catalyst. (Thanks Triadian!)</li>
	<li>Classic: Fixed a problem with the default stat weights where Pawn was 
	suggesting dual-wielding weapons for protection warriors and paladins 
	instead of using a shield.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.38</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Burning Crusade Classic: The new Shattered Sun gems for Content Phase 5 will now show 
	up in recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.37</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed that annoying problem where the green tooltip border would 
	overstay its welcome if you hovered over an upgrade item and then something 
	else like a spell button.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.36</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Burning Crusade Classic: Added support for new Zul'Aman items that use a 
	different wording for their spell damage and healing. (Thanks wwwbbat!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.35</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Shadowlands: Includes new stat weights for all classes and specs from 
	Ask Mr. Robot.</li>
	<li>Burning Crusade Classic: Pawn will now suggest Runed and Bright Crimson 
	Spinel, as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.34</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Burning Crusade Classic: Fixed a problem where the spell damage portion 
	of Teardrop Crimson Spinel was getting counted toward healing as well (30 
	healing and 8 spell damage, but it should be 22+8) in Russian.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.33</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Shadowlands: Pawn no longer values domination sockets since domination 
	shards no longer function outside of the Maw.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.32</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Burning Crusade Classic: The new gems for Content Phase 3 will now show 
	up in recommendations, and will be taken into account when determining the 
	value of sockets on Black Temple gear.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.31</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can now type things like "/pawn tooltip 186767" or "/pawn tooltip 
	186459::::::::60:257:::1:7883:2:9:60:28:888" to reconstruct an item in-game, 
	for example if you see its item ID on a screenshot from someone who has 
	Pawn's "Show item IDs" option enabled. (You probably won't ever need to use 
	this, but it should be handy for me!)</li>
	<li>Fixed MP5 detection on some items in the German version of Classic Era 
	Season of Mastery. (Burning Crusade Classic and other languages were not 
	affected.) (Thanks ruffiely!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.30</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem where domination sockets were undervalued in the default 
	Ask Mr. Robot scales for tanks and healers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.29</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed the look of the socketing advisor tooltip on WoW 9.1.5, which also 
	fixes an error that started with 9.1.5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.28</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem where domination sockets could get counted twice.</li>
	<li>Fixed a minor bug where Pawn's socketing advisor would stay visible when 
	shift-right-clicking an item with a prismatic socket and then 
	shift-right-clicking an item with a domination socket, without first closing 
	the socketing window.</li>
	<li>If you have scale values visible on tooltips (they're hidden by 
	default), you can now hover over the Pawn button when inspecting another 
	player to see their total scores (using <em>your</em> character's scales) on 
	Classic, like you can in Shadowlands. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.27</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Items with only a domination socket will no longer show a blank 
	socketing advisor when you shift-right-click them, since Pawn doesn't 
	suggest domination shards.</li>
	<li>You can now assign a value to domination sockets on an item. For Pawn's 
	default scales, I've chosen a very conservative value for the stat that 
	assumes that you <em>aren't</em> raiding Sanctum of Domination. The initial 
	value I've chosen is 45× the value of Leech, which is provided by the 
	Desolate Shard of Rev which anyone can easily attain without raiding. For 
	someone who does raid Sanctum of Domination and has access to better shards 
	and their class's domination set bonus, this default value will be far too 
	low, so you'll want to increase it to something more appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.26</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The "color tooltip border of upgrades" feature now works again without 
	errors on the 9.1.5 PTR.</li>
	<li>Incorporated a couple of changes from players on CurseForge that will 
	hopefully improve compatibility between Pawn and ArkInventory.</li>
	<li>Burning Crusade Classic: Added support for new types of items with holy 
	spell damage in English, French, Russian, Latin American Spanish, European 
	Spanish, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese versions of Burning 
	Crusade Classic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.25</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Additional Pawn updates to accomodate changes made in French Burning 
	Crusade Classic, and to fix a bug I introduced in the previous version that 
	only affected French versions of the game.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.24</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now once again recognize specific schools of spell damage on 
	items in French Burning Crusade Classic. (Other languages, Classic Era, and 
	Shadowlands were not affected.)</li>
	<li>Made a couple of small changes to help make French compatibility 
	problems easier to fix in the future.<ul>
		<li>For the curious, in French it's normal to put a space before AND 
		after a colon, as in "Équipé&nbsp;: Augmente...". Sometimes, Blizzard uses a 
		"non-breaking space" instead of a regular space before the colon, and a 
		regular space after, which is also common. Unfortunately, they're not 
		consistent; sometimes they just use two regular spaces. And you 
		can't <em>see</em> the difference, but to code, 
		those two spaces are as different as A and Z. With this change, Pawn will now always treat 
		non-breaking spaces and regular spaces the same.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.23</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixes a harmless but annoying error that could occur when interacting 
	with socketed items in Shadowlands.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.22</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a few bugs relating to meta sockets in Burning Crusade Classic. 
	The base values of helms with meta sockets will be (correctly) somewhat 
	higher after this change, and the current values of a fully-socketed helm 
	(if you have those turned on) may be significantly higher.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where Pawn couldn't read the damage stats on the few 
	rare crossbows that deal an exact, non-random damage with every attack 
	(Crossbow of the Albatross, Fine Light Crossbow) on French versions of 
	Classic Era and Burning Crusade Classic. Other languages and other crossbows 
	were not affected.</li>
	<li>Added some additional debugging information to help me understand some 
	tricky aspects of gem calculations in the future. (That means even more chat 
	spam when debug mode is on!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.21</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When using the option to ignore gems while leveling (which is <em>
	enabled</em> by default) on Burning Crusade Classic, Pawn will now no longer 
	suggest that you use gems on items with an item level below 100. This means 
	that those items will get lower values, and also that Pawn will no longer 
	suggest using green-quality gems in any item by default. You can restore the 
	(approximate) previous behavior by disabling that option on the Options tab. 
	(That option affects all characters.)</li>
	<li>Added support for more items with spell crit in English and French 
	Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
	<li>A few Shattered Sun / Sunwell gems that don't appear until Burning 
	Crusade Classic Phase 3 have been removed from recommendations, since 
	they're not available yet.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where socket bonuses would always be ignored on items in 
	Traditional Chinese Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug on Burning Crusade Classic where the Compare tab would show 
	a socket bonus even when it would be better to ignore the socket bonus and 
	only use your best gems. (Item values and upgrade advice were not affected; 
	this was just a display issue.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a harmless error that would appear when logging in on Traditional 
	Chinese versions of WoW.</li>
	<li>Slightly improved performance on Italian Shadowlands.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.20</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn should finish its item calculations about 5% faster now.</li>
	<li>Added support for more types of items with melee and ranged crit rating 
	in French, Latin American Spanish, European Spanish, Korean, and Simplified 
	Chinese Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.19</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an error that could appear when hovering over an item ("attempt to 
	get length of field 'Values' (a nil value)").</li>
	<li>Added support for more types of items with different amounts of spell 
	damage and healing on the same line of the tooltip in Russian Burning 
	Crusade Classic.</li>
	<li>Added support for more types of items with MP5 in French Burning Crusade 
	Classic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.18</h3>
<ul>
	<li>While leveling in Shadowlands (non-Classic), Pawn will now suggest 
	potential upgrades to heirloom items that used to provide an experience 
	boost, since those items no longer do and there's less of a downside to 
	replacing them.</li>
	<li>Added support for more types of "the Sorcerer" items in Burning Crusade 
	Classic in several languages.</li>
	<li>Added support for more types of items with MP5 in Simplified Chinese and 
	Traditional Chinese Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
	<li>Added support for more types of items with different amounts of spell 
	damage and healing on the same line of the tooltip in Traditional Chinese 
	Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.17</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I'm trying out a new workaround for a couple of game bugs that caused 
	Pawn to work much more slowly on Classic Era and Burning Crusade Classic.<ul>
		<li>Other than just still not being fast enough, the most likely thing 
		that might break with this change is Pawn missing some of the stats on 
		items that appear in green text, such as ratings in Burning Crusade 
		Classic. (I haven't spotted any bugs with those—but if anything did 
		break, it's probably that.)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Additional performance improvements that affect all versions of the 
	game.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.16</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for more types of items with crit rating on German Burning 
	Crusade Classic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.15</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for more types of Wrath items (Fiery Wrath, etc.).</li>
	<li>Added "Thrown weapon" to the list of weapon types that you can add 
	values to (or mark as unusable) on the Values tab for Classic Era and 
	Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
	<li>Classes that can't use thrown weapons have them marked as unusable in 
	the default scales, so by default they won't show as potential upgrades.</li>
	<li>Added support for more types of items with spell damage and healing on 
	the same line of the tooltip, and more with MP5, on English Burning Crusade 
	Classic.</li>
	<li>Added support for more types of items with crit rating on Russian 
	Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
	<li>Fixed a couple of bugs causing health regeneration on items to not be 
	recognized on French versions of the game.</li>
	<li>Further improved the formatting of how some item IDs are displayed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.14</h3>
<ul>
	<li>On Classic and Burning Crusade Classic, Pawn will no longer suggest mail 
	as upgrades for hunters and shamans or plate for warriors and paladins 
	before level 40 in some places.</li>
	<li>Added support for additional types of items with shield block rating and 
	dodge rating.</li>
	<li>You can now use Enter and Escape to close the popups that appear when 
	using the Scale tab (export, confirm delete, etc.).</li>
	<li>Pawn will now claim that fewer items have "special effects" on the 
	Compare tab if the "special effect" is something at the top of the item 
	tooltip like "Mythic." (This doesn't affect item values or upgrade advice in 
	any way, just the orange diamond on the Compare tab.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.13</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem where Pawn was suggesting random items instead of cut 
	Golden Draenite gems. (The item values and upgrade advice were correct; it 
	was just showing the wrong item name. I apologize to anyone who tried to 
	shove a two-handed mace into a yellow gem socket.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where shamans were being treated as if they could 
	dual-wield on Classic Era.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.12</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for items with spell penetration in Classic Era. (They're 
	already supported in Burning Crusade Classic.)</li>
	<li>Added support for the handful of armor penetration items that will 
	appear in later phases of Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
	<li>Worked around a bug in the Russian and Latin American Spanish versions 
	of Burning Crusade Classic that would cause Pawn to show errors if you had 
	items with a healing enchantment or random property.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Included several gem cuts that were missing from suggestions, including 
	Runed and Teardrop—sorry, casters!</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where many of the gems suggested on Burning Crusade 
	Classic were being suggested based on stats and colors that they had at 
	different points in the game's history (Wrath or Cataclysm). You should see 
	more sensible suggestions in the socketing advisor, and the values of 
	socketed items may slightly increase.</li>
	<li>Added support for "of Healing" and "of the Prophet" items on Burning 
	Crusade Classic. (Thanks to neaves for tracking down the items and a 
	suggested fix!)<ul>
		<li>On Latin American Spanish and Russian, "of Healing" items currently 
		don't show the spell damage granted. Once that bug is fixed, Pawn will 
		need an additional change to handle those items properly.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fixed an error that would occur on Burning Crusade Classic when looking 
	at an item that has sockets but no meta socket. (Thanks to ahakola for a 
	suggestion and the many people who reported this.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a minor issue with how some item IDs were displayed (a missing 
	colon).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Meta gems are now supported. You can manually assign a weight per scale 
	to the special meta gem effects such as 
	"Minor&nbsp;Run&nbsp;Speed&nbsp;Increase"&nbsp;or&nbsp;"1%&nbsp;Spell&nbsp;Reflect"; the stat portion of a meta 
	gem will be calculated for you. (A good starting point is 36× the value of 
	your primary stat.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where Pawn wouldn't work at all on Italian Shadowlands.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where feral attack power wasn't working on English 
	Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>On Burning Crusade Classic, when determining a socketed item's value, 
	Pawn will now decide whether the item's value would be maximized by 
	following the socket bonus, or ignoring the bonus and using all of the same 
	type of gem.<ul>
		<li>The socket bonus will also be taken into account for the advice 
		given in the socketing advisor popup.</li>
		<li>The socket bonus will also be shown on Pawn's Compare tab whenever 
		the item's value would be maximized by following the socket bonus.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem with wands that deal holy damage on all Russian versions 
	of WoW.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem with some items that grant mana-per-5 on Russian Burning 
	Crusade Classic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn now includes colored sockets in the value of an item like it does 
	for prismatic sockets. Colored sockets are assigned a value automatically 
	based on the best gems that fit that socket's color of an appropriate 
	quality level for the item. Like prismatic sockets, there's no way to 
	manually override the value of a colored socket or to fine-tune the quality 
	level of the gem used in the calculation.</li>
	<li>Colored and meta sockets are now shown on Pawn's Compare tab.</li>
	<li>The socketing advisor will now appear for socketed items in Burning 
	Crusade Classic.</li>
	<li>Added support for more items with spell hit rating on Burning Crusade 
	Classic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added the Gems tab in Burning Crusade Classic.<ul>
		<li>Gems with Haste are not currently visible, since they won't appear 
		until Black Temple opens.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The value of stamina in the Classic and Burning Crusade Classic default 
	scales for DPS specs was too high and has been reduced to a more reasonable 
	level.</li>
	<li>Added support for some additional caster enchantments on English Classic 
	and Burning Crusade Classic. (This was accidentally listed in the notes for 
	2.5.6 in some places, but it's not fixed until 2.5.7.)</li>
	<li>Simplified the look of some item IDs when the Show Item IDs option is 
	enabled.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a few problems with items that give bonuses to a single type of 
	magic damage in European Spanish Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for items with feral attack power on Burning Crusade 
	Classic.</li>
	<li>Added support for more items with defense rating on Burning Crusade 
	Classic.</li>
	<li>Added support for more items with hit rating on Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
	<li>Added support for more items with spell hit rating on Simplified Chinese 
	Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
	<li>Fixed problems with weapon damage in Traditional Chinese Burning Crusade 
	Classic.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem with Outland items with melee and ranged crit rating on 
	European Spanish Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem with items with school-specific spell damage on European 
	Spanish Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed the calculation of DPS of wands on Portuguese and Korean Burning 
	Crusade Classic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for more Outland items with spell crit rating on Burning 
	Crusade Classic.</li>
	<li>Added support for more Outland items with the same amount of spell 
	damage and healing on Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem where Pawn missed crit rating on some Outland items in 
	Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where Pawn couldn't determine the DPS of wands in French 
	Burning Crusade Classic.</li>
	<li>Fixed many problems where Pawn missed stats in European Spanish Burning 
	Crusade Classic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for various items with hit rating and attack power that 
	weren't being handled properly before.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where items with different values of spell damage and 
	healing on the same line of the tooltip were getting the two stats reversed, 
	even though I literally <em>triple-checked</em> that before releasing Pawn 
	2.5.</li>
	<li>Minor updates to the German translation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.5</h3>
<p>Introducing: Pawn for the Burning Crusade 
	Classic pre-patch.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> If you imported custom scales on Classic and are continuing 
to Burning Crusade Classic, you'll need to update your 
weights for all of the percentage-based stats when you get the pre-patch. If, for example, your value for 
Crit is 10, an item that gives 1% crit would be worth 10 points on Classic, but 
would be worth 80 in Burning Crusade Classic and the pre-patch, because that 
item will change to have 8 crit <em>rating</em>. Pawn won't make any automatic 
changes to your custom scales. But, if you're using the default stat weights 
that come with Pawn, you don't need to do anything.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for all Burning Crusade Classic languages: 
	English, French, German, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Latin American Spanish, 
	European Spanish, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.<ul>
		<li>Known issue: The Spanish PTR currently has a bug where items are 
		showing spell hit and spell crit as percentages instead of ratings. Pawn 
		currently processes these items correctly, but once the bug is fixed, 
		Pawn will need an additional adjustment to work again.</li>
		<li>Known issue: The Russian PTR has the same problem with spell hit.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Added support for new stats: Expertise Rating, Resilience Rating, Haste 
	Rating, Spell Haste Rating, and Spell Penetration.</li>
	<li>Added support for new combat ratings present on Classic gear: Hit 
	Rating, Spell Hit Rating, Crit Rating, Spell Crit Rating, Dodge Rating, 
	Parry Rating, Block Rating, and Defense Rating.</li>
	<li>Added support for items that give different amounts of spell damage and 
	healing on the same line (Amulet of Flowing Life, etc.).</li>
	<li>The default stat weights on Burning Crusade Classic have been updated to 
	accommodate the combat ratings change.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.18</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Russian WoW Classic: You should no longer see a warning about addon 
	incompatibility when logging in.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.17</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added ArkInventory integration, contributed by a Pawn fan named Matthew. 
	(Well, I don't know if he <i>said</i> he's a fan. I'm assuming here.)<ul>
		<li>When you have ArkInventory and ArkInventoryRules enabled, you can use the <code>pawnupgrade()</code> rule in
ArkInventory to run a Pawn comparison on items in your inventory for sorting. This will return true if the item is
an upgrade and false if it is indeterminate or not an upgrade. To determine if something is not an upgrade, use
<code>pawnnotupgrade()</code>. This rule will return true if the item is definitely not an upgrade, and false if it is
indeterminate or an upgrade. This can be used for auto-sell rules, such as <code>bind(3) and pawnnotupgrade()</code>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.16</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Shadowlands: Pawn will now suggest the +16 stat jewel clusters instead 
	of +12 stat gems for items level 175 and higher.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.15</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Shadowlands: Updated stat weights for Guardian Druid based on a new 
	simulation from Ask Mr. Robot.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.14</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Spanish, Shadowlands only: Fixed a problem where off-hand frill items 
	were being misidentified as off-hand weapons, so they didn't show upgrades 
	or values for casters. (This problem didn't apply to Classic or to other 
	languages.)</li>
	<li>Spanish, Spain only, Classic only: Fixed a problem where an error 
	message appeared when logging in.</li>
	<li>Spanish: Fixed detection of Avoidance and Block Value on some items in 
	certain situations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.13</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Shadowlands: I've included a new set of stat weights from Ask Mr. Robot 
	yet again—the most notable changes will be for healers, who will see the 
	value of mastery increased significantly.</li>
	<li>Improved a few bits of the Italian translation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.12</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Shadowlands: Pawn 2.4.11 included the wrong set of stat weights; this 
	version includes the stat weights that were <i>intended</i> to come with 
	2.4.11. Apologies for the error!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Shadowlands: Pawn now includes new default stat weights for all classes 
	and specs from Ask Mr. Robot, optimized for typical characters in Mythic 
	Keystone dungeons. These should give you much better gearing advice than the 
	previous defaults, but remember that you'll always get the most accurate 
	advice for your character if you import stat weights from your favorite 
	simulator (like Ask Mr. Robot).</li>
	<li>Pawn's "compare item left" and "compare item right" keybinds work 
	with world quest item rewards once again.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Worked around a bug in WoW that was causing Pawn to show incorrect 
	upgrade information for some Shadowlands quest rewards.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where clicking links in chat and then right-clicking the 
	window that appeared would open Pawn's Compare tab even if it was for 
	something that wasn't an item, such as an achievement.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added Pawn annotations for tooltips of item rewards in the Great Vault. 
	(I think. Thanks Crazy Carl!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn can now recover and continue working if another addon changes any 
	of the class colors and does so incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Changed the graphics in the Pawn UI to look more Maw-like.</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: In German, mail armor is now properly detected again after 
	the Naxxramas patch.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will no longer appear as "out of date" after updating to WoW 9.0.2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: In Russian, shadow spell damage is now properly recognized 
	on items. (This problem didn't affect other schools of magic or other 
	languages.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn's bag icons should now cooperate with Can I Mog It?'s bag icons 
	again. Special thanks to the author of that addon, who inspired a much 
	simpler solution that what I had come up with.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn now has a more complete set of gem recommendations, including new 
	gems from the Shadowlands. For example, for resto shamans on an ilvl 100 
	item, Pawn will suggest five different +4 crit gems from different 
	expansions, so you can buy the one that's cheapest.<ul>
		<li>This is just new recommendations, not a new feature—there still 
		isn't a way to further customize gem quality levels to your exact 
		tastes, but that's still on the to-do list.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Pawn was a little overzealous in resetting data that might have been 
	affected by the level squish, so I've changed the way it works to be less 
	annoying for people who have a lot of alts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Pawn's bag arrows integration will no longer work by default with 
	custom bag addons.</b><ul>
		<li>The game no longer allows customizing that functionality while in 
		combat, so before this change, Pawn's bag arrow integration caused 
		errors while performing certain actions in combat, such as swapping 
		weapons from the character sheet. Disabling support for custom bag 
		addons is unfortunately the only way I can work around this.</li>
		<li>To work around this, custom bag addons that call 
			IsContainerItemAnUpgrade directly can use 
			PawnIsContainerItemAnUpgrade when available instead, falling back to 
			IsContainerItemAnUpgrade if it's nil. Then Pawn will control the bag 
		arrows like it did before.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Pawn will now show two-handed weapons as potential upgrades for 
	two-handed Frost Death Knights. If you're all about the dual-wielding life 
	and want to turn this back off, you can go to Pawn's Values tab, select 
	"Axe: 2H" (or any other 2H type) under "Weapon types", and then select 
	"Don't show upgrades for 2H items."</li>
	<li>You should no longer see a warning message about addon compatibility 
	when playing on Russian WoW 9.0.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Hopefully fixed an error that occurred when turning in a 
	quest.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Welcome to WoW 9.0 and the level squish! Pawn had to wipe its memory of 
	everything it knew about your characters before the squish since none of 
	that information is correct anymore, so for a little while it might show you 
	upgrades that aren't actually upgrades until it learns about your sweet 
	epics. This shouldn't last long, and will automatically resolve itself as 
	you play.<ul>
		<li>This version is meant for WoW 9.0 (Shadowlands pre-patch) and WoW 
		Classic only.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Pawn should give reasonable gem recommendations and calculations in this 
	version, but I'll continue to refine them in the coming days to give more 
	helpful suggestions at lower levels.</li>
	<li>Default stat weights have not been updated. Players participating in 
	high-level raiding may want to import custom weights from a simulator 
	instead of using the built-in guidance.</li>
	<li>The Corruption stat has been removed, since it no longer has any effect 
	on your character and appears greyed out.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where if a quest gave you a useful item and a junk item 
	(such as a gray artifact power item from Legion), Pawn would sometimes fail 
	to show upgrade arrows on the non-junk item.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.36</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Added support for parry chance on items. (The UI has been 
	there all this time, but it didn't actually work. Oops!)</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Fixed some problems with Benediction and some other items 
	with spell damage and healing that only occurred when playing in Simplified 
	Chinese.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.35</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Added support for dodge arcana and cloak enchantments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.34</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Pawn will no longer incorrectly show axes as potential 
	upgrades for rogues.</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Added support for Fel-Infused Leggings in Simplified 
	Chinese, which work differently from seemingly every other item in the game 
	with shadow spell damage because Blizzard hates me.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.33</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Added support for "of Sorcery" items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.32</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I broke the Korean version in 2.3.31—it's fixed now.</li>
	<li>One more small update to the German translation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.31</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Shadowlands: Adjusted the level at which characters get their armor 
	specialization ability.</li>
	<li>Shadowlands: Pawn will now start showing upgrades to Legion artifact 
	weapons again.</li>
	<li>Updated the German translation, thanks to SunnySunflow.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.30</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>This release adds Shadowlands compatibility to Pawn.</b></li>
	<li>Shadowlands: Pawn's UI will no longer be see-through.</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Fixed a problem where Pawn would no longer show your score 
	totals when hovering over the Pawn button after equipping a relic-slot item.</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Fixed a problem where shadow spell damage was no longer 
	being recognized in Simplified Chinese. (Other languages weren't affected.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.29</h3>
<ul>
	<li>One-handed maces and daggers will no longer incorrectly appear as 
	potential upgrades for demon hunters, since they cannot equip them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.28</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I rearranged the Values tab, making the stat list wider, to make it 
	easier to use in languages where some stat names are very long like 
	"Puissance d'attaque en changeforme."</li>
	<li>Various minor updates to the sizes of things in the UI to make Pawn more 
	pleasant to use in a variety of languages.</li>
	<li>Lots more updates to the French translation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.27</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Significant updates to the French translation, courtesy of CerealCH.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.26</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a rare error that could occur when looking at very unusual rings.</li>
	<li>Pawn is now compatible with a slightly wider array of item tooltip 
	comparison addons.</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Fixed a problem where spell damage on some items in French 
	wasn't being recognized.&nbsp; (Other languages weren't affected.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.25</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem where if scale values on tooltips were enabled, and you 
	had a trinket with no stats (such as Pocket-Sized Computation Device or most 
	trinkets in WoW Classic), Pawn wouldn't show the total score of all of the 
	items you're wearing when hovering over the Pawn button on the character 
	sheet.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where Leech (Parasitar / Robo de vida) was not 
	recognized on items in either Spanish version of WoW.</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Fixed multiple problems reading numbers when playing in 
	French introduced by the latest patch for WoW Classic.&nbsp; (Battle for 
	Azeroth isn't affected.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.24</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Fixed a problem where Pawn would cause an error when using 
	the "Track for each scale (advanced)" option because it would try to scan 
	your equipment sets, which don't exist on Classic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.23</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Battle for Azeroth: Pawn now works in the new(-ish) 8.3.0 auction house.<ul>
		<li>Important: Items with random stats ("of the _____") will be 
		undervalued on the main auction house browsing page, and will be 
		unlikely to appear as upgrades.&nbsp; When you click the item name to 
		see all of the individual auctions for that item,<i> those</i> items 
		will get accurate rankings from Pawn.&nbsp; (This is because the game 
		groups multiple similar items with varying stats together on the initial 
		screen, but the items listed on the second screen have exact stats that 
		Pawn can evaluate.)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.22</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Fixed a lot of additional problems with the European 
	Spanish version of WoW Classic.&nbsp; (Latin American Spanish and Battle for 
	Azeroth weren't affected.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.21</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Fixed a problem where Pawn couldn't read damage on weapons 
	in the European Spanish version of WoW Classic.&nbsp; (Latin American 
	Spanish and Battle for Azeroth weren't affected.)</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Fixed a problem where Pawn couldn't read damage on wands in 
	the Portuguese version of WoW Classic.</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Improved the Simplified Chinese translation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.20</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Fixed an issue where the new Classic stat weights included 
	with Pawn valued stats like crit chance as if they were the Burning 
	Crusade-style ratings, not percentages, so all of the percentage-based stats 
	were severely undervalued.&nbsp; (This has no effect on you if you're using 
	your own stat weights, or if you're playing Battle for Azeroth.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.19</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I worked around a bug in BankItems and other addons that use the old 
	auction house that was causing Pawn to fail 
	catastrophically.</li>
	<li>Pawn will now work with even more complicated corrupted items than 
	before ("didn't expect to find 11 bonus IDs").</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.18</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Pawn now includes a full set of starter scales for each 
	class and spec courtesy of
	<a href="http://tbcwowaddons.weebly.com/pawn.html" target="_blank">HawsJon</a>.&nbsp; 
	These stat weights were originally designed for use on The Burning Crusade, 
	not Classic, but they're the best resource for Classic stat weights that 
	I've found so far.<ul>
		<li>Druids have two scales for feral: DPS (cat) and tank (bear), since 
		your preferred role will dictate which stats are most valuable.</li>
		<li>Rogue off-hand weapons use different weights than other rogue gear, 
		so there's a fourth scale for rogues that you should only use when 
		comparing items for your off-hand slot.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Removed an error message that appeared when playing in Spain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.17</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn can now handle more complicated items than before.&nbsp; This fixes 
	a problem where you could get an error like "didn't expect to find 9 bonus 
	IDs" after looting a very complicated item.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.16</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated German translation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.15</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW 8.3 PTR: Added support for the Corruption stat.&nbsp; If you assign 
	it a value, you probably want to assign it a <i>negative</i> value.</li>
	<li>WoW 8.3 PTR: Fixed a problem where high-level weapons would cause errors 
	when playing in French.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.14</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Scale tags can now specify a class like on retail.&nbsp; 
	When you import a scale that specifies a class, Pawn will now automatically 
	mark all of the weapon and armor types that class can't equip as unusable 
	just like it does on retail.&nbsp; (Specs included in scale tags for Classic 
	will be ignored.)</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: For Korean players, wand damage should now be interpreted 
	correctly and no longer produce an error message.</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Fixed a problem where the retail-only option to only use 
	your class's preferred armor type after level 50 was still showing up on 
	leather, mail, and plate armor.</li>
	<li>Improved the "Items with this are unusable" text on the Weights tab in 
	English.</li>
	<li>Made a small tweak to the Pawn UI's tabs to help people who use custom 
	fonts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.13</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the Pawn logo.</li>
	<li>Pawn dialogs that ask for scale names, and the delete scale confirmation 
	dialog, have been returned to the more compact appearance that they had in 
	version 2.3.10 and earlier.</li>
	<li>WoW 8.3 PTR: Fixed a problem where Pawn would no longer load on the PTR.</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Ranged weapons are now properly supported.</li>
	<li>Added a special surprise.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.12</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When exporting Pawn scale tags, unusable stats will now appear simply as 
	"Stat=X" instead of "Stat=-1000000".</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: A basic starter scale for each class is now available.<ul>
		<li>The starter scales include default values for all stats relevant to 
		the class, loosely based on the game's item level formula.&nbsp; 
		(They're very similar to the default stat weights that came with Pawn a 
		decade ago.)</li>
		<li>There is just one starter scale per class, so for example, the druid 
		template has values for Strength, Agility, Intellect, <i>and</i> Spirit.</li>
		<li>The appropriate starter scale will be automatically enabled when 
		starting Pawn for the first time (if you don't already have any scales) 
		so it does <i>something</i>.</li>
		<li>I still <i>highly</i> recommend customizing the default values.</li>
		<li>The "Template" button on the Scales tab is now available, and 
		creates a new scale based on your class's starter scale.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Pawn will now allow items that aren't your class's 
	preferred armor type to be considered as upgrades after level 50, since 
	non-cloth healers using cloth armor was commonplace and optimal in early 
	WoW.&nbsp; <i>[Vger wistfully remembers her Crimson Felt Hat from Strat...]</i><ul>
		<li>The option that appears to enable this feature whenever you select 
		an armor type on the Weights tab has been removed.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: The Manual button on the Scales tab is now visible, even 
	though you can't switch to Automatic on Classic so the button is always 
	selected.&nbsp; (Other parts of the Pawn UI refer to "switching to Manual 
	mode" and I didn't want to have to change them all.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Now supports Korean and Traditional Chinese.&nbsp; With 
	that, Pawn now supports all WoW Classic languages!</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Fixes for frost spell damage in Simplified Chinese.</li>
	<li>The Import and Export windows for scale tags are now larger and can be 
	closed with the Esc key.</li>
	<li>If you experience a problem with Pawn incorrectly finding the stats for 
	an item, you can put that item into the Compare tab and then Alt+click it to 
	see a full list of the item's stats and a command that can be used to see 
	the same item on a different computer.&nbsp; (You probably won't have a 
	reason to use this unless I ask you to.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Additional updates to the Simplified Chinese translation.</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Now supports Russian, thanks to drcrazy777.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Additional updates to the Simplified Chinese translation from wolfcon.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Now supports Portuguese.</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Now supports Simplified Chinese, thanks to wolfcon.</li>
	<li>Some updates to the Russian translation, courtesy of drcrazy777.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Now supports Spanish and German.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: the Compare tab will now refresh itself after a moment to 
	make sure it has the latest stats from your items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>/pawn compare can now compare two items at once: /pawn compare left 
	12345 right 67890</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug introduced in Pawn 2.3.0 that made it impossible to import a 
	scale with a class and spec specified the first time you tried.</li>
	<li>Fixed problems with baguette damage in French WoW.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Now supports French in addition to English.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem introduced in WoW 8.2.5 where Pawn wouldn't recognize 
	numbers 1,000 or larger in the Russian version of WoW—not the same one as 
	for French and Spanish!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a new Pawn slash command: /pawn compare.&nbsp; You can use this as 
	an alternate way to put items into Pawn's Compare UI.&nbsp; For example, 
	"/pawn compare left 16795" puts Arcanist's Crown into the left slot of 
	Pawn's Compare tab.<ul>
		<li>The compare command accepts item IDs, "item:12345:0:0" strings, or 
		full shift+clicked item links ("/pawn compare [Arcanist's Crown]").</li>
		<li>If your PC hasn't downloaded the stats for an item yet, the command 
		might not do anything the first time.&nbsp; Try it again (Enter, 
		Shift+Up, Enter) after a second and it should work the second time.</li>
		<li>Addon authors can use "PawnUI_SetCompareItemAndShow(1, 16795)" to 
		accomplish the same thing.&nbsp; (1 for left, 2 for right.)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where armor was being ignored in French WoW.</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Worked around a problem where Pawn would sometimes not see 
	all of the stats on an item (typically, the "green stats").<ul>
		<li>This workaround will result in slightly lower performance on WoW 
		Classic.&nbsp; I'm still investigating a better long-term solution.</li>
		<li>For the curious, it's because the game client would get a partial 
		list of stats for the item, then Pawn would do its calculations on that, 
		and then shortly afterward the game would get the rest of the stats for 
		the item, but at that point Pawn didn't know that it needed to re-scan 
		the item, so it was evaluating the item based on just the first batch of 
		stats it got.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Removed "All Resistances", which does not appear to exist 
	on any items in Classic.</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Added support for "of Concentration" items.</li>
	<li>Russian and Chinese: For consistency, Pawn's "debug" and "backup" slash 
	commands are now always in English like they are for all other languages.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem introduced in WoW 8.2.5 where Pawn wouldn't recognize 
	numbers 1,000 or larger in the French and European Spanish versions of WoW.</li>
	<li>I introduced a system that will make Pawn a little easier to translate 
	in the future, and make it more resilient to changes in the way that 
	non-English versions of WoW display numbers.</li>
	<li>WoW Classic: Added support for ranged weapon DPS, "of Defense" items, 
	and probably more stuff I forgot about.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>WoW Classic: Added support for "of Eluding" items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3</h3>
<p>Consider this version a full release for Battle for Azeroth and a beta for 
WoW Classic.&nbsp; WoW Classic is supported for English only in this version.&nbsp; 
Pawn does not include any built-in scales for WoW Classic, so you'll need to 
create your own scales from scratch, or import them.&nbsp; Not all Pawn features 
exist on WoW Classic, and some features are incomplete.</p>
<ul>
	<li>There are no new features for Battle for Azeroth in this version.&nbsp; 
	If you run into any issues on the live/retail realms, you can return to 
	2.2.x and shouldn't miss out on anything.</li>
	<li>The "show item level upgrades" feature will default to OFF in Classic.&nbsp; 
	(But, if you've already used one of the earlier versions of Pawn on Classic, 
	that option may already be on, so turn it off manually if you don't want it.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.46</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If you've used an addon to hide item levels from your items, but still 
	have Pawn's "show item level upgrades" option turned on (that's the 
	default), Pawn will now show the item level increase at the bottom of the 
	tooltip instead. </li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where Pawn could forget your best items after logging 
	out, if using the "track for each scale (advanced)" feature.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.45</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Includes updated stat weights from Ask Mr. Robot for all classes and 
	specs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.44</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now show equippable items that are a higher item level than 
	what you currently have as upgrades too, even if they aren't stat upgrades.&nbsp; 
	(You can turn this new behavior off on Pawn's Options tab.)<ul>
		<li>This feature currently doesn't take Unique-Equipped rings into 
		account.&nbsp; If you happen to equip two different item level copies of 
		the same ring, Pawn could consider both of them your best two rings and 
		thus "forget" about your previous second-best ring.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Some minor performance improvements when logging in.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where characters with artifacts equipped could get 
	upgrade recommendations for types of items they can't equip, such as wands 
	for death knights.</li>
	<li>Fixed a harmless error that appeared when logging in on a Russian 
	client.</li>
	<li>Lots of updated German translations, courtesy of SunnySunflow.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.43</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Removed a harmless error that would occur when shift-right-clicking 
	Pocket-Sized Computation Device.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.42</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for the new 60-stat epic gems from Nazjatar.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.41</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Some minor changes to try to work around a problem where Pawn tries to 
	compare a new item versus an old item but it doesn't know the stats of the 
	old item, and it causes an error.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.40</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Removed some old code that isn't necessary anymore in 8.1.5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.39</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an additional problem with an "ItemButtonTemplate" error that 
	would appear if you have the "/console scriptErrors 1" setting on.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where Pawn would show an unnecessary error message to 
	French players.&nbsp; You know, the one I said I fixed in 2.2.37.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.38</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed some problems with the Compare tab's visuals introduced by patch 
	8.1.5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.37</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem where Pawn would show an unnecessary error message to 
	French players.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.36</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New stat weights from Mr. Robot for all classes and specs!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.35</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Increased the item level threshold at which Pawn will start suggesting 
	BfA rare-quality gems.</li>
	<li>Added a warning Pawn detects that you're using an addon like Combat 
	Numbers Separator that might cause it to give bad advice.&nbsp; (Let me know 
	if you see this with only Pawn active!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.34</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixes to prevent errors involving "WorldMapTooltip" from occurring on 
	WoW 8.1.5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.33</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Better compatibility with DejaCharacterStats.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.32</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A debug-only option that I added long ago will now automatically turn 
	itself off if you turned it on and then forgot about it.&nbsp; ("Not caching 
	because the item didn't have any stats" and other similar messages.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.31</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem that occurred on the Spanish (EU) version of WoW (not 
	the Mexico version or other languages) where items with 1,000 or more of a 
	stat were being evaluated incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.30</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Includes new, updated stat weights for all classes and specs from Ask Mr. Robot's 
	simulations to give you better, more accurate advice in raids.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.29</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixes for Brazilian Portuguese.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.28</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will no longer suggest weapon upgrades for mistweaver monks as if 
	they could dual-wield.</li>
	<li>Adjusted gem recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.27</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn's relic upgrade features are now disabled by default, and I plan to 
	remove them entirely in a future version.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.26</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Items with sockets will now be valued somewhat higher than before, to 
	account for the new gems in Battle for Azeroth jewelcrafting.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where sometimes you'd get an error when looking at items 
	that your PC hadn't downloaded the stats for yet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.25</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed some more issues with artifact weapon level comparisons (notably, 
	comparing versus the surprisingly crappy weapons you get during the Battle 
	for Lordaeron questline).</li>
	<li>Fixed the average item level display on the Inspect window when hovering 
	over the Pawn button.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.24</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When comparing an artifact weapon with a non-artifact weapon, Pawn now 
	just shows upgrade arrows based on the item's level.&nbsp; Artifact weapons are 
	complicated, and this seemed like the most helpful and least confusing way 
	to provide guidance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.23</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where Pawn could skip one of your equipment sets when 
	looking for your best-in-slot gear when the "upgrade comparisons: track for 
	each scale" option was enabled.</li>
	<li>Updated artwork.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.22</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will no longer tell you that it's probably not worth your time 
	putting gems in anything below ilvl 800.&nbsp; (I changed the threshold to 
	153, and I'll change it again when BfA launches.)</li>
	<li>Pawn will now show upgrades for your artifact weapons (and off-hands) on 
	all level 110+ characters.</li>
	<li>More gem updates in preparation for the Battle for Azeroth jewelcrafting 
	recipes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.21</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New default stat weights for the Battle for Azeroth pre-patch 8.0 for 
	all classes and specs!</li>
	<li>Fixed some problems that occurred when the "Upgrade comparisons: Track 
	for each scale" option was selected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.20</h3>
<ul>
	<li>More gem updates for the Battle for Azeroth item level squish.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.19</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated for WoW 8.0 and the Battle for Azeroth item level squish.&nbsp; 
	Due to item level changes, gem recommendations may be a little strange at 
	lower levels; let me know if you see something that seems very wrong, and 
	let me know which item and gem and the item levels of each.</li>
	<li>Stat weights have not been updated since WoW 7.x.&nbsp; They're still 
	the latest from Ask Mr. Robot; most likely it will take a couple of months 
	to account for all of the expansion changes and produce reliable new stat 
	weights.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.18</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an occasional 
	incompatibility with TradeSkillMaster where upgrade arrows would appear in 
	bags too often.&nbsp; (Special thanks to Curse user Katmandu29a.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.17</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where relic upgrade info wasn't visible on tooltips anymore 
	when the "align values to right edge of tooltip" option was enabled. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 2.2.17a</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem with the German translation of relic upgrade 
	notifications.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.16</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the default Ask Mr. Robot scales for all classes and specs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.15</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a fix to make Pawn compatible with the German version of WoW 7.3.2 
	courtesy of Salty from Curse.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.14</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now suggest blue-quality gems on heroic Tomb of Sargeras gear 
	or better, and the epic-quality gems on heroic Antorus gear.</li>
	<li>Translation updates for German courtesy of Salty from Curse.</li>
	<li>(Version 2.2.14a) Translation updates for French courtesy of 
	Kangourousse from Curse.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.13</h3>
<ul>
	<li>More language updates for WoW patch 7.3.&nbsp; (If I do four of these 
	updates I get a special cache full of epics.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.12</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem introduced by WoW patch 7.3 that caused Pawn to not work 
	properly in the Spanish (Spain) version of WoW.</li>
	<li>More updates for WoW patch 7.3.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updates for compatibility with WoW patch 7.3.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a compatibility fix for AethysRotation and other addons that scan 
	your artifacts while you're logging in.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Stat weights for all classes and specs have been updated based on hotfixes, 
	balance changes, and new simulations.</li>
	<li>Pawn will now suggest blue-quality gems only on items that are higher 
	than level 900.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added new guidance and stat weights for all classes and specs to account 
	for changes in WoW patch 7.2.5.&nbsp; The new weights are optimized for 
	Mythic Keystone dungeons a higher gear level (870) than in previous versions 
	of Pawn, given how quickly one can gear up alts currently.<ul>
		<li>In addition, the new weights for Assassination Rogues now assume 
		that you use Master Poisoner.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem in Korean WoW that was introduced in 2.2.7.</li>
	<li>Additional changes to French support to improve performance for players 
	in all languages.</li>
	<li>Lots of translation updates for Portuguese courtesy of Pawn fan tiagopl.&nbsp; (No updates for other 
	languages in this update.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn is now compatible with the French version of WoW patch 7.2.5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now wait to start suggesting relics for the third slot of your 
	artifact until you've actually unlocked it.&nbsp; (I thought it would be 
	helpful for collecting a relic before you finish the questline, but it's 
	proven to be annoying and misleading in practice.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Made a change to try to improve integration with Bagnon.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in Pawn where for some low-level characters, Pawn wouldn't 
	recognize that one of your artifact's relic slots was locked, and would 
	suggest relics for that slot.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>English: Fixed a problem where the Survival Hunter artifact Talonclaw 
	didn't ever show relic upgrades.&nbsp; (It's possible that this problem 
	exists for other artifacts—it would occur any time that the artifact had a 
	different name on the item tooltip versus the shift-right-click artifact 
	pane.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Worked around a game bug where WoW was saying that BoE relics looted at 
	level 110 and then passed to lower-level characters would get fewer ilvls 
	from that relic than they actually would.</li>
	<li>Some other addons simulate shift-right-clicking on your artifact at 
	logon to get information about it.&nbsp; This caused Pawn to sometimes 
	receive incorrect information about your artifact, which would cause it to 
	overestimate how much of an item level upgrade a relic would be.&nbsp; Pawn 
	will now detect when this is happening and ignore the bad information it 
	received.</li>
	<li>Russian: Includes translations for new relic features.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in Pawn 2.2 where items in a player's bags that required a 
	higher player level and couldn't be equipped were still getting green 
	arrows.</li>
	<li>Pawn will no longer work with WoW 7.1.5.</li>
	<li>English: Relics that give a single level increase will now say "+1 level" instead 
	of "+1 levels".</li>
	<li>Russian: Hopefully fixed some of the catastrophic problems that started 
	occurring with patch 7.2.</li>
	<li>Italian: Includes translations for new relic features.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Includes fixes for compatibility with WoW patch 7.2.</li>
	<li>Pawn will now highlight relics that are an item 
	level upgrade to one or more of your artifacts.&nbsp; Note that this upgrade 
	feature is completely separate from Pawn's existing upgrade features—it's 
	based on item level increase, not stats, and your custom scales are not used 
	in any way.<ul>
		<li>This feature won't work until after you shift-right-click your 
		artifacts.&nbsp; You only have to do that once (for each artifact) after 
		upgrading to Pawn 2.2.</li>
		<li>This feature will work for all of your artifacts regardless of which 
		spec you're in.</li>
		<li>Top-tier players who want to min/max specific artifact traits rather 
		than focusing purely on their artifact's item level may want to turn 
		this feature off—see Pawn's Options tab to do so.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Pawn will now suggest the cheap 100-stat gems on more items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.18</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where balance druids could see weapons appear as upgrades to 
	their off-hand frill items, as if they could dual-wield.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.17</h3>
<ul>
	<li class="auto-style1">Updated the Ask Mr. Robot default scales for most 
	specs.&nbsp; (The ones that didn't change already had the latest stat 
	weights.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.16</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When copying built-in scales, the spec icon (as well as other internal 
	details) will now be copied as well.</li>
	<li>The Compare tab will now refresh itself whenever it's shown, so changing 
	scale values or an option that affects calculations like "ignore sockets on 
	low-level items" will have an immediate effect.</li>
	<li>Fixed a minor bug where one of the details of each scale was being saved 
	incorrectly.&nbsp; (Neither the bug nor the fix should have an immediate 
	impact as the feature to use that detail isn't available in Pawn yet.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.15</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated default stat weights from Ask Mr. Robot for The Nighthold and the latest hotfixes.</li>
	<li>When the Pawn button is set to the left side, it will now appear in its 
	usual location on the <i>right</i> side of the item socketing window.&nbsp; 
	(It was originally intended to not be visible at all if the left setting was 
	used, but that hasn't displayed properly in ages and no one complained, so I 
	guess it probably doesn't cause any problems there.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.14</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug introduced in 2.1.13 where the list of scales in the Pawn UI wouldn't show or 
	hide immediately upon switching between Automatic and Manual mode.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.13</h3>
<ul>
		<li>Scales that are imported with both Class and Spec included will use 
		spec icons and class colors by default, just like the built-in Automatic 
		scales.&nbsp; (Pawn will automatically include them when exporting any 
		of the built-in scales.)<ul>
			<li>Scales you've already imported in previous versions need to be 
			re-imported for this to work.</li>
			<li>There's currently no way to change a scale's class, spec, or 
			icon in the Pawn UI other than through the export and import 
			features.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Pawn scale tags can now specify a spec using its English name instead of 
	just a number.&nbsp; For 
	example: ( Pawn: v1: "Hunter: Beast Mastery": Class=Hunter, 
	Spec=BeastMastery, Agility=10 )<ul>
		<li>Scales exported in this version can't be imported into earlier 
		versions of Pawn, so for the next few weeks while people may not have 
		updated, if you share scales with others, you may need to remind them to 
		upgrade.&nbsp; (Or, change Spec= to its old number form: 1 is the first 
		spec listed in the game's Specialization window, 2 is the second, and 3 
		is the third.)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>When using the "show item IDs" option, Pawn will once again show item 
	IDs for items that can't be equipped (food, relics, crafting reagents, and 
	so on).</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the color picker would disappear too soon when 
	choosing a scale color.<ul>
		<li>There's still a bug where the initial color that appears when 
		choosing a new color is incorrect, but that's a problem with the game 
		itself.&nbsp; (For example, you can see the same issue with the chat 
		window color options.)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Worked around a problem where the item level display that appears when 
	hovering over the Pawn button while inspecting another player would 
	undervalue off-hand artifacts (including weapons, shields, and frill).&nbsp; 
	(The game shows the item level of off-hand artifacts as 750 regardless of 
	their actual level, so Pawn works around the bug by assuming that the 
	off-hand artifact is always the same level as the main-hand artifact.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.12</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New updates to the default Ask Mr. Robot scales for patch 7.1.5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added some new unverified changes that will hopefully eliminate the problem a few 
	people are seeing where items are missing stats and causing other items to 
	show up as upgrades when they aren't.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the Template button on the Scale tab didn't work.</li>
	<li>Made some minor changes that should slightly improve performance with 
	certain items that can never have stats, like artifact relics and tabards.</li>
	<li>Updated all of the default Ask Mr. Robot scales with new stat weights.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Additional minor changes to help debug a problem some people are having 
	with items missing stats.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Performance enhancements based on suggestions from rowaasr13 of Garrison 
	Mission Manager.</li>
	<li>Pawn's Bag Upgrade Advisor will no longer show green arrows on items in 
	your bags that aren't equippable yet because you don't meet the level 
	requirement.&nbsp; (You'll still see them if you hover over the item.)</li>
	<li>Added support for the comparison tooltips that appear when holding Shift 
	over the point-of-interest icon for a world quest that rewards an equippable 
	item.</li>
	<li>The "compare item left" and "compare item right" keybinds now work on 
	world quest rewards.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated stat weights from Ask Mr. Robot for changes in patch 7.1 and 
	recent hotfixes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a mistake I introduced in version 2.1.6 that caused characters to 
	become undying servants of the Lich King if they use Automatic mode (the 
	default), which caused Pawn to not show anything on tooltips, and make it 
	appear as if Pawn thought that your spec was Blood in the Pawn window.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Improved performance in raid groups when in Automatic mode (the 
	default).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Increased Pawn's memory usage in exchange for faster item scans.&nbsp; 
	(Memory usage should still only be a couple MB, but finding bag upgrades 
	should be much faster.)</li>
	<li>Minor translation updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where occasionally Pawn would complain about finding too 
	many "bonus IDs" on items.</li>
	<li>Removed the "ignore valor and baleful upgrades" feature, since those 
	items are not relevant anymore.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated translations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Compare tab will no longer show the differential between the sockets 
	and socket value on the left item versus the right item.&nbsp; (For example, 
	if one item has no socket, and the other has a socket worth 1,250 points, it 
	will no longer show "+1,250".)&nbsp; After this change, the green and red 
	numbers shown will always only be stats, which should make them easier for 
	new people to understand.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where it was no longer possible to export some scales 
	(generally, scales that were created using the "empty" button or importing, 
	rather than copying an existing scale or starting from a template).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now take over the new WoW 7.1 feature that puts green arrows 
	on items in your bags.&nbsp; Normally the feature shows you items that are a 
	higher item level than what you have equipped.&nbsp; Pawn will change the 
	feature so that it shows items that are an upgrade to your 
	currently-equipped gear for any of your active scales.&nbsp; (For example, 
	if you're in the default Automatic mode, it'll put upgrade arrows next to 
	items that are better for your current spec, but not for other specs.)<ul>
		<li>This feature has no effect on the WoW 7.0 live realms.</li>
		<li>If you don't like this, and would rather go back to the old 
		behavior, uncheck "Show bag upgrade advisor" on Pawn's Options tab.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn's default stat weights now come from Ask Mr. Robot!&nbsp; The 
	existing Wowhead placeholder scales have been removed, and the Ask Mr. Robot 
	scales work automatically in the same was as the previous placeholders, but 
	now have more appropriate and helpful advice for each specialization.<ul>
		<li>If you'd like advice for more than one spec at once, switch to 
		Manual mode on the Scales tab, and then you can show and hide additional 
		scales from there.</li>
		<li>You may notice that items in your bags or bank that weren't upgrades 
		before version 2.1 are now showing up as upgrades—that's to be expected, 
		as some of the new stat weights in this version are vastly different 
		than before.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>In the English version, the Values tab has been renamed to Weights, to 
	better match the generally accepted terminology.</li>
	<li>The item level display on the Compare tab will no longer show the 
	difference between the two levels ("+15" etc.).&nbsp; I'm hoping that this 
	makes it clearer that the item level isn't used in calculations.</li>
	<li>Pawn will no longer add orange diamonds to special effects that it 
	doesn't understand on items.&nbsp; I felt that in modern versions of Pawn, 
	those were just clutter, and didn't really provide useful information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0.14</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The previous version of Pawn fixed Latin American Spanish while breaking 
	European Spanish.&nbsp; This version should hopefully work for both.&nbsp; 
	(There's a new difference in the way that numbers are displayed between the 
	two versions of WoW that I wasn't aware of previously.&nbsp; Sorry!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0.13</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Hopefully fixed a problem when Pawn is used in Spanish where stats 1,000 
	and up would be massively undervalued.</li>
	<li>When choosing between relics as quest rewards, Pawn's Quest Upgrade 
	Advisor will now show the same (?) icon that it does for trinkets, instead 
	of showing you which one to choose to vendor.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0.12</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn's Quest Upgrade Advisor will now also help you identify upgrades 
	rewarded by world quests.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the values of Broken Isles gems again after the recent hotfix.&nbsp;
	<i>FFS, Blizzard.</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The "ignore gems while leveling" feature will now ignore sockets on 
	items below ilvl 800.</li>
	<li>Made a small tweak to work around a problem that was reported where an 
	error occurred when trying to sell a battle pet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the values of Broken Isles gems.&nbsp; Pawn will no longer 
	vastly overvalue sockets on Broken Isles gear.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixes to the French translation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem that could occur on some new items where Pawn would 
	display an error message about not expecting an item with 5 bonus IDs.</li>
	<li>Minor update to the Simplified Chinese translation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem where one-handed weapons could show up as huge upgrades 
	for characters who can't dual-wield.&nbsp; (They were being compared against 
	the character's off-hand frill item or shield.)</li>
	<li>Updated Korean translation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now show "your best" and "your second best" on tooltips of 
	equipped rings and dual-wielded weapons when using the default settings.</li>
	<li>When the item on the left side of the Compare tab is better, its upgrade 
	arrow will now be green like all other upgrade arrows in Pawn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>By popular demand, the Ignore Valor and Baleful Upgrades option has 
	returned.&nbsp; It's on by default, but you can turn it off to better 
	compare new gear.<ul>
		<li>I'll wait to remove this option until Legion actually launches.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A few more translation updates for Russian.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Made a hopefully-better fix for the problems on the Russian version of 
	WoW.</li>
	<li>Updated translation for Russian.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where one-handed weapons would appear to be upgrades for 
	dual-wielding characters far too often.</li>
	<li>Hopefully fixed a problem where numbers 1,000 and up were being 
	calculated incorrectly in the Russian version of WoW.</li>
	<li>Updated translations for Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, 
	Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Adjusted the value of gems to account for a difference in the values of 
	Draenor gems on the live version of the patch versus what they had on beta.</li>
	<li>Increased the item level threshold at which Pawn will start suggesting 
	that you use Legion gems so that you shouldn't see that happen on your 
	Mythic Hellfire Citadel gear.&nbsp; <i>(Looks at own gear and weeps softly)</i></li>
	<li>Updated translations for Spanish and Italian.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.0</h3>
<p>Pawn 2.0 only works on World of Warcraft 7.0, the Legion prepatch.</p>
<h4>New features and big changes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>By default, Pawn will now automatically make suggestions based on your 
	current spec and nothing else, and it will automatically switch its 
	suggestions whenever you change specs.&nbsp; If you prefer to show multiple 
	specs on your tooltips and customize them, just go to the Scale tab and 
	switch to Manual.</li>
	<li>To keep things simple, when deciding whether a new item is an upgrade, 
	Pawn will now just compare it against what you currently have equipped.&nbsp; 
	This should be more straightforward now that gear works for all specs, and 
	better mimics the way that other RPGs with similar features (like Diablo) 
	work.&nbsp; You can return to the previous Pawn behavior if you prefer by 
	switching to Manual mode on the Scale tab, and then checking "track for each 
	scale" on the Options tab.</li>
	<li>All of the built-in scales have been rebuilt from scratch.&nbsp; For 
	now, the stat values are simplified and are not coming from Wowhead, but I 
	expect to resume getting expert advice from them in the coming weeks.<ul>
		<li>Please report any bugs you find with incorrect item types marked as 
		not being usable, and so on!</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other less exciting stuff</h4>
<ul>
	<li>This version now supports all of the languages that Pawn 1.9 
	supported—special thanks to the Pawn translation volunteers!<ul>
		<li>Not all 
	translations are complete yet, but if you do notice something completely 
	broken, please let me know what, and which language.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The Pawn UI visuals have now been slightly tainted by the Fel.</li>
	<li>Pawn will now show spec icons on your tooltips (only for default 
	scales), which should make them easier to find and tell apart.&nbsp; You can 
	turn this off on the Options tab.</li>
	<li>Built-in scales that are designed for only your current class will no 
	longer show the class name on item tooltips.&nbsp; For example, "Havoc: +14% 
	upgrade" instead of "Demon Hunter: Havoc: +14% upgrade".</li>
	<li>Pawn's gem database has been fully updated to account for the stat 
	changes in patch 7.0.</li>
	<li>To keep the suggestions manageable, Pawn will no longer consider 
	multi-stat (green, orange, or purple) gems on low-level items.</li>
	<li>The Gems tab has been simplified, and will no longer show each gem three 
	times (under red, yellow, and blue gems).</li>
	<li>The "Defaults" button on the Scale tab has been removed.&nbsp; A new 
	"Template" button has been added, which creates a more useful scale to start 
	from for your current spec.</li>
	<li>Pawn's Socketing Advisor now gives a full list of gems when you have 
	Automatic mode enabled (which is the default).</li>
	<li>Pawn's features for assuming that you'll use Valor and Baleful tokens to 
	upgrade your items have been removed.</li>
	<li>Removed support for Bonus Armor, Spirit, Multistrike, Spell Power, and 
	colored sockets, as those stats have been removed from the game.</li>
	<li>Removed support for meta sockets, PvP Resilience, and PvP Power, as 
	those stats are not relevant on any current gear (though they do still exist 
	in-game, such as on the Dreadful Gladiator sets).</li>
	<li>Dodge and Parry on low-level items and tank heirlooms will now be 
	interpreted as if it were Stamina.</li>
	<li>Attack Power on low-level items will now be interpreted as if it were 
	Strength or Agility, whichever your scale values most.</li>
	<li>I expect that for most players, Pawn's memory usage will decline 
	significantly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug fixes and minor tweaks for 7.0</h4>
<ul>
	<li>I improved the "getting started" text that probably nobody reads.&nbsp; 
	Now it'll take even less time for people to not read it.</li>
	<li>The Pawn UI now opens to the Compare tab by default (except the first 
	time you open it).</li>
	<li>Fixed a rare division by zero error that could occur when wearing 
	cosmetic armor with no stats.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.31</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Partial gem support has been restored on the Legion beta.&nbsp; The new 
	Legion gems will be used in all calculations regardless of the level of the 
	item.&nbsp; It'll probably stay this way until close to the Legion release 
	date.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.30</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Due to a problem with Pawn's gem calculations interacting poorly with 
	the quest turn-in window (yes, you read that right) on the Legion beta, gem 
	calculations on the Legion beta are temporarily disabled.<ul>
		<li>This doesn't affect characters on the live servers.</li>
		<li>This will cause items with sockets on the Legion beta to be valued 
		the same as the same item without sockets.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.29</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed the "Change color" button on the Scales tab on the Legion beta.&nbsp; 
	(Thanks Eduard from Curse! :)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.28</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for the new Legion gems.&nbsp; (But you can't see them on 
	the live realms.)</li>
	<li>Warglaives will no longer show up as usable for any class except demon 
	hunter.</li>
	<li>More minor tweaks to the basic starting scale for demon hunters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.27</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A few quick tweaks to make Pawn work better on the Legion beta realms.<ul>
		<li>There's plenty of stuff yet to do, like removing obsolete stats, and 
		adding support for artifact weapons—that will come soon.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Added a basic starting scale for demon hunters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.26</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated Spanish and Simplified Chinese translations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.25</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for a few Baleful items that weren't being recognized 
	previously.&nbsp; (If you're really curious, bonus ID 653.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.24</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Items in the Heirloom collection window will now get Pawn annotations on 
	their tooltips.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug introduced in 1.9.23 where, when hovering over the Pawn 
	button on your character sheet while the "show scale values and upgrade %" 
	option was chosen, the total values for all equipped items were not being 
	displayed properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.23</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When Pawn shows you an upgrade percentage for an item that requires 
	Valor and/or an Empowered Apexis Fragment to achieve, it will now show up as 
	"+X% upgrade potential" instead of merely "+X% upgrade".&nbsp; Hopefully 
	this will make it a bit clearer how an ilvl 650 baleful item can be a 
	significant upgrade over an ilvl 670 raid item.<ul>
		<li>This change will only affect English at first, until translations 
		are available.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.22</h3>
<ul>
	<li>For Baleful items, Pawn will now use the Empowered version of the item 
	(the one that you get with an Empowered Apexis Fragment that's level 695 
	before valor upgrades) when calculating the base value of an item.</li>
	<li>Added an option to make Pawn no longer assume that you'll use Valor and 
	Empowered Apexis Fragments to upgrade your gear when comparing different 
	items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.21</h3>
<ul>
	<li>For items upgradeable with Valor, Pawn will now use the fully-upgraded 
	version of the item when calculating the base value of an item.&nbsp; (The 
	current value of the item, which is not shown on tooltips by default, will 
	still use the current upgrade level.)&nbsp; This means that when comparing 
	(for example) a level 630 item that isn't upgradeable to a level 650 item 
	that is, the upgrade % shown will be about 1.5x what it was previously.&nbsp; 
	Upgrade percentages between two upgradeable (or two non-upgradeable) items 
	will remain roughly the same as before.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where tooltips for craftable items did not get Pawn 
	annotations (values and upgrade %).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.20</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Works around a WoW bug where quest reward items were not getting Pawn 
	information on their tooltips most of the time.&nbsp; (Special thanks to 
	Phanx for helping to track down more patch 6.2 compatibility problems!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.19</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn now includes data for the Immaculate Taladite epic gems, and will 
	suggest them for items level 695 and up (Mythic Blackrock Foundry / Heroic 
	Hellfire Citadel).</li>
	<li>Pawn now knows about Khadgar's legendary rings.</li>
	<li>Preparation for translation into Korean.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.18</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Various diagnostic changes to help me identify the compatibility 
	problems with patch 6.2, and some attempted fixes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.17</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A few updates to make Pawn work better on WoW patch 6.2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.16</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The "Special effects were not included in the value" message that you'd 
	see at the bottoms of tooltips for trinkets and enchanted weapons has been 
	removed.</li>
	<li>The (?) icon used to indicate special effects on items has been replaced 
	with a small orange diamond (like in Diablo III).</li>
	<li>Support for crystals of fear and sha-touched sockets, cogwheels and 
	cogwheel sockets, and assigning a fixed value to the effect portion of a 
	meta gem (2% chance to restore mana, etc.) have all been removed, as those 
	features are no longer relevant in any current content.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.15</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now work with AtlasLoot again.</li>
	<li>Included some improvements to the Portuguese translation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.14</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where sometimes Pawn would save over custom key bindings set 
	up by certain addons, such as ElvUI.</li>
	<li>Included updates and improvements to the Italian translation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.13</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Included a variety of updates and improvements to the French 
	translation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.12</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Included the correct version of the French translation (with the changes 
	from 1.9.10, which were accidentally reverted in the 1.9.11 release).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Significant changes to the built-in Wowhead scales.&nbsp; (Note that 
	this iteration doesn't include spell power, attack power, or weapon DPS.&nbsp; 
	This is the design of the Wowhead scales, not a problem with Pawn.)</li>
	<li>Lots of further improvements to the Spanish translation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem where weapon speed was not read properly in Spanish.</li>
	<li>Made a few changes to try to make the French version of Pawn understand 
	large numbers (1,000 or greater) better.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Given their exorbitant cost, Pawn will no longer suggest Greater 
	Taladite gems on gear lower than item level 685 (mythic Highmaul).</li>
	<li>Fixed the problem where some new Draenor wands caused an error to appear 
	in the chat log and did not have their DPS calculated correctly.</li>
	<li>Attempted to fix a problem in Spanish where numbers greater than 1,000 
	were not read properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New scales from Wowhead have been integrated into Pawn, and the starter 
	scales that Pawn previously included have been removed.</li>
	<li>Includes a new Spanish translation, which is still a work-in-progress.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the socketing advisor would always unhelpfully suggest 
	that you put a gem "of any color" into a prismatic socket.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where It was difficult or impossible to change the color of 
	a scale, depending on where the Pawn window is situated.&nbsp; (It was 
	difficult if the scale list happened to be behind the color window.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you opened your chest of Garrison Resources and the last item you won 
	(it showed up in a "you won!" popup) was an upgrade, the Garrison Resources 
	would also show up as an upgrade.&nbsp; (Hey, maybe you got some Complicated 
	Wood instead of Simple Wood.)</li>
	<li>Removed the code that dealt with Wrathion's Breath of the Black Prince 
	item, which added sockets to certain weapons, but is no longer obtainable by 
	new players and not relevant to current content.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Stamina can't be marked as "unusable" 
	in custom scales.&nbsp; (Since multiple primary stats are on most armor 
	pieces now, marking those as unusable leads to some confusing and unexpected 
	results.)</li>
	<li>Made a couple small improvements to the French, German, and Traditional 
	Chinese translations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now no longer suggest gems for items below level 630 (level 
	100 heroic dungeon).&nbsp; (This change is particularly noticeable for 
	helms, which had high-value meta sockets at level 90, but not at level 100.)</li>
	<li>Improved the German and Simplified Chinese translations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Additional changes to try to prevent the "UseSpecialQuestItem" error 
	from occurring when clicking items in the objectives list.</li>
	<li>More improvements to the Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese 
	translations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Dodge and Parry on low-level items will now be treated as if they were 
	Bonus Armor, at a 2:1 ratio.&nbsp; (40 Parry on an item will be treated as 
	20 Bonus Armor.)</li>
	<li>Pawn will now once again work with AtlasLoot even when the "Use 
	GameTooltip" AtlasLoot setting is off.&nbsp; (Release versions only, not the 
	latest AtlasLoot beta.)</li>
	<li>The warrior tank starter scale now properly has a value for bonus armor.</li>
	<li>Included lots of improvements to the Traditional Chinese translation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Changed the way that Pawn uses item tooltips, in the hopes that it will 
	prevent issues where the game blocks certain buttons and actions due to 
	"taint."</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where a few settings wouldn't be saved when logging out, 
	including Pawn's list of your best items used for determining upgrades.</li>
	<li>Included new French translations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Continued changes to the starter scales and translations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Bonus armor is now listed as a separate stat from base armor and can be 
	given a value independently.</li>
	<li>Significantly increased the value of armor and bonus armor in the tank starter 
	scales.</li>
	<li>Fixed a harmless error where a message about #(Item1.UnknownLines) could appear 
	in the chat log when using the Compare tab.</li>
	<li>Fixed a harmless error where a message about being unable to parse the 
	item link could appear in the chat log when hovering over a caged battle 
	pet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated for WoW 6.0 and Warlords of Draenor.&nbsp; Many features have 
	changed in some way as a result of item changes in patch 6.0.</li>
	<li>I updated the visuals for the Pawn UI to be a little more warlordy.</li>
	<li>A new set of starter scales have been added for all classes and specs.&nbsp; 
	You can use these scales as you would the old Wowhead scales, and you can 
	also customize them to your heart's content.</li>
	<li>The Wowhead scales have been disabled since they haven't been updated 
	for patch 6.0 and would do more harm than good.</li>
	<li>The values of Pawn's default scale have changed to be a more appropriate 
	starting point for WoW 6.0.</li>
	<li>New stats are recognized and can be assigned values on the Values tab: 
	Bonus Armor, Multistrike, Versatility, Movement Speed, Leech, Avoidance, Indestructible.</li>
	<li>Obsolete stats (hit, etc.) are removed from your scales upon logging in, 
	and have been removed from the UI.</li>
	<li>All of the new Taladite gems in Warlords of Draenor are now in Pawn's 
	database.</li>
	<li>The changes to stats on pre-Draenor gems in Pawn's database have been 
	taken into account for purposes of gem recommendations.&nbsp; (I anticipate 
	that I'll need to do another update of gem stats before the expansion hits.)</li>
	<li>A new option has been added, on by default: "Ignore sockets on low-level 
	items."&nbsp; When this option is enabled, Pawn will ignore sockets when 
	calculating values of low-level items (currently, any item below level 463), 
	so they won't have inflated values when Pawn determines upgrades.</li>
	<li>Pawn's calculations for item values no longer take reforging potential 
	into account since that feature is gone from the game.</li>
	<li>All code for Pawn's Reforge Advisor feature has been removed.</li>
	<li>Changed the way that information about your best items for purposes of 
	determining upgrades is stored and processed.&nbsp; (I now use item links 
	instead of item IDs, since in Warlords of Draenor, a mythic version of one 
	item and the raid finder version of the same item might have the same ID but 
	a different bonus suffix.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Made a tweak to make Pawn's Quest Advisor work better with ElvUI.</li>
	<li>Updated Russian and German translations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The new Timeless, Flexible, Warforged, and Heroic Warforged items will 
	no longer show a (?) next to those terms.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 1.8.10a</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Actually including the right file this time so the fix described in the 
	notes works.</li>
	<li>New German translation updates.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 1.8.10b</h4>
<ul>
	<li>New Russian and Simplified Chinese translation updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Items that an Eye of the Black Prince can be applied to (Sha-Touched 
	weapons from Heart of Fear and Terrace of Eternal Spring, Level 502 
	Blacksmithing weapons, and weapons that drop in Throne of Thunder) will be 
	valued assuming that you add the socket to that weapon.&nbsp; Weapons from 
	heroic scenarios and Siege of Orgrimmar will not.&nbsp; (Previously only 
	Sha-Touched weapons were correctly being valued in this way.)</li>
	<li>Made a few adjustments to try to better handle chest armor that is 
	classified as "robes" by the game.</li>
	<li>Minor changes for patch 5.4.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed some issues with upgrade displays showing incorrect information 
	for wands.</li>
	<li>Fixed some issues with upgrade displays showing incorrect information 
	for characters that don't save healing gear but still have a healing scale 
	enabled.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now no longer show any weapons other than daggers as upgrades 
	for assassination rogues when using the default Wowhead scales.</li>
	<li>Fixed a rare bug that could occur with quests such as Returned Sevenfold 
	that include both a choice of rewards and some guaranteed rewards, where 
	Pawn could incorrectly display upgrade symbols that were intended for the 
	guaranteed rewards on the icons for the reward choices.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem that appears to be new for patch 5.3 where inspecting 
	another player that you're not also targeting would not calculate an average 
	item level for that player's equipment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Adjusted the values of PvP power and PvP resilience on MoP-quality gems 
	to their new (halved) values.</li>
	<li>Added Tense Imperial Amethyst.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A few minor changes to work around a rare issue where Pawn would load 
	files in a different order on some machines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Priests will no longer incorrectly see bows, crossbows, and guns as 
	potential upgrades when using the built-in Wowhead scales.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Sha-touched items from Heart of Fear and Terrace of Eternal Spring (all 
	difficulties) will now always be valued (for base value) as if you've 
	completed Wrathion's Chapter II questline and can add a prismatic socket to 
	the item.</li>
	<li>Added a Brailian Portuguese translation.&nbsp; Thanks maxmag!</li>
	<li>Includes minor updates to the other translations.</li>
	<li>Fixed a couple minor display issues on the Compare tab when one item had 
	sockets and the other did not.</li>
	<li>Thunderforged and Heroic Thunderforged items on the English PTR will no 
	longer show (?) on their tooltips.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in average item level calculations when inspecting hunters.&nbsp; 
	(Their ranged weapons were only getting counted for half the appropriate 
	level.)</li>
	<li>The Reforging Advisor will now also show up when you right-click an item 
	while talking to an arcane reforger.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This version of Pawn now includes French support, thanks to translation 
	volunteers othor and Snuff, and an untested Traditional Chinese translation 
	based on work by BNSSNB.</li>
	<li>Reduced Pawn's memory usage by about 35% (at least on my PC) by 
	optimizing the way translations are loaded.&nbsp; Pawn's memory usage should 
	return to about where it was back when it was for a single language only.</li>
	<li>Corrected a calculation problem where the Ghost Iron Dragonling trinket 
	was undervalued because Pawn suggested Cataclysm cogwheels for it instead of 
	Mists of Pandaria cogwheels.&nbsp; (Thanks durandal42!)</li>
	<li>Fixed a minor problem that could occur when using the Compare tab if you 
	used Pawn in the past (or on another computer), then stopped using it, then 
	sold some of your best items, and then started using it again.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This version of Pawn now works for German and Russian in addition to 
	English.&nbsp; Big thanks to the translation volunteers Sandmahn and 
	mgotovtsev!&nbsp; It also has an untested Simplified Chinese translation 
	based on work by bigbamboo.</li>
	<li>This version also contains a large number of changes to prepare for 
	German, Russian, and more languages in the future.</li>
	<li>Some now-unnecessary information that was being stored in Pawn's 
	SavedVariables file will now be removed when logging out.</li>
	<li>Reorganized the Options tab to make it a bit cleaner.&nbsp; Options for 
	changing the digits of displayed precision for values and for controlling 
	the visibility of (?) icons on tooltips were removed.</li>
	<li>Changed a bunch of bits of text throughout Pawn.</li>
	<li>Worked around a problem that occurred with Pawn annotations showing up 
	on AtlasLoot items twice.&nbsp; (To show Pawn annotations on AtlasLoot 
	items, click Options in AtlasLoot and then check Use GameTooltip.)</li>
	<li>Added support for the Pyrium Weapon Chain and Living Steel Weapon Chain.</li>
	<li>Crystals of Fear will now no longer improperly show (?) on their 
	tooltips.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.7.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now properly show values and/or upgrades for mistweaver monks 
	as intended.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.7.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed another typo that caused Pawn to show an error when high-level 
	engineers opened the Gems tab and prevented cogwheels from showing up in the 
	list.</li>
	<li>Changed the text "best in slot" to "your best" to make it more clear 
	that those items are not the best items you <i>could</i> get (the more 
	traditional definition of that term), but the best that you currently <i>
	have</i>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.7.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an error that occurred when clicking the "Normalize values (like 
	Wowhead)" checkbox on the Values tab as of Pawn 1.7.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.7.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a typo that caused Pawn to show an error when opening the 
	socketing window for an item with a cogwheel socket.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The way that Pawn uses gems and socketed items has changed drastically.&nbsp; 
	Pawn will now take an item's level into account and automatically select 
	gems of an appropriate quality to socket into that item for both the socketing 
	advisor, and also to use in calculating the internal item values for the 
	item.&nbsp; So, an epic from Heart of Fear will have Mists of Pandaria gems 
	suggested for it, and an epic from Naxxramas will have Wrath of the Lich 
	King gems suggested for it, without you having to do anything extra.&nbsp; You can still browse through items of various levels on the Gems 
	tab, but doing so no longer changes any settings and doesn't affect 
	calculations.<ul>
		<li>It is no longer possible to manually set a value for colored 
		sockets, cogwheel sockets, or the stats portion of meta sockets.&nbsp; 
		You can still assign a value to the special effects of meta gems ("3% 
		more damage on crits").</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The Gems tab works a little differently now than it did in previous 
	versions.&nbsp; You can now have it show the best gems overall for a given scale, or you can 
	have it show the recommended gems for an item of a particular level.<ul>
		<li>When clicking the Pawn button that appears on the item socketing 
		window, the Gems tab will now automatically be set up to show you 
		recommended gems for an item of the level you're currently socketing.</li>
	<li>Since Pawn doesn't understand the special effects of meta gems but those 
	are the most important parts of meta gems, Pawn will no longer attempt to 
	suggest meta gems for you.&nbsp; You should instead use online class guides 
	to select the most appropriate meta gem.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Sockets appear a little differently on the Compare tab than they did in 
	previous versions.&nbsp; The Compare tab will now show you the total 
	value of all sockets and socket bonuses on an item, including colored 
	sockets (either the correct colors of gems plus the socket bonus or all of 
	your best gem, depending on which strategy maximizes the item's value), meta 
	sockets (including the meta effect bonus), cogwheels, and sha-touched 
	weapons.&nbsp; It will also tell you whether you should go for the socket 
	bonus for a particular item without having to open the socketing advisor (so 
	you can find out on items you don't own).</li>
	<li>Made various other small improvements to the Compare tab to handle items 
	with large numbers of stats and scales with large values, so you don't see 
	things like "(+1234..." when numbers get too big to fit on the screen.&nbsp; 
	Now you'll see "(+12.3k)" instead.</li>
	<li>Added some features to make Pawn work with 
	some item tooltip changes in patch 5.1.</li>
	<li>Added new monk scales from Wowhead and removed the placeholder scales 
	for monks that were provided in earlier versions.</li>
	<li>When using the default settings, Pawn will now show you which of your 
	two rings is better so it's easy to tell which one you should replace with 
	your new one, instead of just saying "This is one of your best items."&nbsp; (This information was already available if you turned on 
	the "Show scale values and upgrade %" option.)</li>
	<li>The "add a blank line before values" option is now on by default because 
	it fits the new item tooltip style in patch 5.1 better.&nbsp; You can turn 
	it back off if you don't like it.&nbsp; I made a few other minor 
	modifications to tooltip formatting.</li>
	<li>Pawn will now show a very clear error message if you try to use the 
	English version of Pawn on a non-English World of Warcraft client.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug introduced as of WoW 5.0 that prevented item levels from 
	showing up on the Compare tab.</li>
	<li>Made a few changes to the way that Pawn starts up that might help some 
	people who were having random troubles with Pawn not working properly 
	immediately upon logging in.</li>
	<li>Pawn 1.7 introduces a ton of changes to the calculation engine.&nbsp; 
	I ran a variety of tests, but please let me know if you notice any 
	anomalies.&nbsp; (If you report an issue, let me know which item and scale 
	you're seeing it on, and what appears to be wrong.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the Wowhead scales for all classes and specs except monks.&nbsp; 
	There are significant changes included for: Protection warrior, Protection 
	paladin, Beast mastery hunter, Assassination rogue, Combat rogue, Discipline 
	priest, Holy priest, Frost death knight, Unholy death knight, Elemental 
	shaman, Guardian druid.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>By default, if you have a two-handed weapon equipped, Pawn will now not 
	show one-handed weapons or off-hand frill items as upgrades, and vice-versa.&nbsp; 
	(This is determined solely based on your character's currently equipped 
	weapon.)&nbsp; Enable the "Show upgrades for both 1H and 2H" option on the 
	Options tab to get back the old behavior, where Pawn will try to keep track 
	of your best two-handed weapon, main hand weapon, and off-hand weapon or 
	frill item separately, and show you upgrades for all of them, even if you 
	didn't typically use that type of item.</li>
	<li>Changed the way that Pawn thinks about upgrades compared to heirloom 
	items.&nbsp; Previously if you had an heirloom that scaled from level 1 to 
	80 that granted an XP bonus, it would never suggest another item as an 
	upgrade to that one until you hit level 81.&nbsp; Now it will immediately 
	start showing upgrades to that item upon hitting level 80, because those 
	items stop granting bonus XP as soon as you hit level 80.</li>
	<li>Made a change for a Spanish translation (in development) due to the fact 
	that the Spanish version of World of Warcraft doesn't use commas in numbers 
	like the English version (12,345) or periods like the German version 
	(12.345)—it displays with neither (12345).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added some placeholder scales for monks so that you can use Pawn as you 
	level your pandas!&nbsp; Once more reliable numbers are available I'll 
	include those, but these should be more than sufficient while leveling.<ul>
		<li>Since they're not from Wowhead, they'll show up in a separate 
		"Placeholder scales" category.&nbsp; This new category will sort at the 
		bottom of the list.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The Wowhead scales will now never show ranged weapons as upgrades for 
	warriors and rogues, nor melee weapons as upgrades for hunters.</li>
	<li>Fixed another issue that Pawn had with understanding certain Mists of 
	Pandaria items with lots of stats.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a version mismatch issue I introduced with the latest update that 
	caused the Compare tab to not work properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where when the Loot Upgrade Advisor is disabled, the group 
	loot / need before greed roll window wouldn't appear.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a nasty calculation bug that occurred on items with more than 999 
	of a stat (the stat would only get 1/1000th of the correct number of 
	points).</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where sometimes using LinkWrangler and Pawn at the same 
	time would cause an error to appear when logging in.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Reimplemented the Loot Upgrade Advisor for the new group loot roll 
	windows in WoW 5.0.&nbsp; It should be functionally equivalent to the old 
	Loot Upgrade Advisor (green arrows on upgrades, and a yellow popup telling 
	you which scales and items it's an upgrade for).</li>
	<li>Added upgrade arrows to items in the Loot Rolls ("/loot") window and the 
	You Won! window.</li>
	<li>Temporarily altered the Wowhead hunter scales to include Expertise (at 
	the same values as Hit) until Wowhead updates their stat weights for 5.0.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the Socketing Advisor tooltip obscured most of the 
	Socket Gems button.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where weapon damage on heirloom weapons would not get 
	properly recognized and counted (and would spam your chat log with an 
	error).</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where an error could occur when hovering over certain gemmed 
	relic items.</li>
	<li>Fixed a harmless error that could appear when trying to put a relic or 
	throwing weapon into the slots in the Compare tab.&nbsp; (You just can't let 
	that vendor trash go, can you?)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for Pawn values on items in Void Storage.</li>
	<li>The spell penetration stat has been converted into the PvP power stat.&nbsp; 
	Any scales that had spell penetration now have PvP power in its place.</li>
	<li>The IsRelic and IsThrown stats are now gone, with no replacement (since relic 
	items and thrown weapons are now vendor trash).</li>
	<li>The stats list on the Values tab has been reorganized slightly.</li>
	<li>The Pawn window is now jade-colored and includes high-resolution art for 
	those of us with 30" monitors.</li>
	<li>Elite- and Heroic Elite-quality items will no longer show an unnecessary 
	(?) icon in Mists of Pandaria.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Initial compatibility with Mists of Pandaria and World of Warcraft 5.0.&nbsp; 
	Not all features will work properly on WoW 5.0 at this time.<ul>
		<li>No built-in scales are available for monks at this time.&nbsp; If 
		you'd like to test out Pawn on a monk but don't have custom stat values 
		you want to use, you have two options:<ul>
			<li>Make a copy of the stat values for the most similar druid spec: 
			go to the Scales tab, click the appropriate druid spec, click Copy, 
			and give the new scale a name.</li>
			<li>Start from a set of default stat values: go to the Scales tab, 
			click Defaults, and give the new scale a name.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Fixed the issue where Pawn couldn't understand stats on tooltips 
		that were greater than 999 and now display with a comma.</li>
		<li>Added support for the new, generally shorter names of stats 
		("critical strike" instead of "critical strike rating", "pvp resilience" 
		instead of "resilience").</li>
		<li>Fixed an issue where monks would get errors when hovering over 
		armor.</li>
		<li>The Loot Upgrade Advisor is not functional in WoW 5.0.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that was causing Pawn to no longer function 
	properly after preordering Mists of Pandaria.</li>
	<li>Added the new level 90 Mists of Pandaria gems to the Gems tab if you're 
	using Pawn on Mists of Pandaria or the 5.0 PTRs.</li>
	<li>Removed the elemental resistance stats since they're not present on 
	modern gear.</li>
	<li>Removed the distinction between bonus armor and base armor since the 
	last items to feature bonus armor were in Wrath of the Lich King and Mists 
	of Pandaria isn't adding any.</li>
	<li>Added a potential bug fix for some sporadic problems where if some 
	players' addons load in a certain order, Pawn might not get initialized 
	properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.20</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a rare bug that could occur when showing the Loot Upgrade Advisor 
	when an upgrade drops and your computer didn't have the stats for the 
	previous best item for one of your scales from the server yet.</li>
	<li>Fixed (I believe) a long-standing bug where the same ring could be 
	chosen as both your first and second best item for that slot.&nbsp; (Thanks 
	to WildCard_25 for the investigation!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.19</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Non-caster classes will no longer have off-hand frill items suggested as 
	upgrades to their off-hand weapon by default (in the Wowhead scales), even if the secondary stats are 
	better, because this almost certainly just means that they aren't 
	dual-wielding, not that the item is <i>actually</i> useful.</li>
	<li>Fixed a minor issue where conflicts with other addons could sometimes 
	cause an error when trying to calculate the average equipped item level of a 
	player you're inspecting.&nbsp; (Pawn still can't calculate the item level 
	in these cases, but it won't cause an error or display inaccurate 
	information.)</li>
	<li>Updated the default Wowhead stat values for warriors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.18</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the average item level calculation for Fury warriors who 
	use two two-handed weapons.</li>
	<li>Added Pawn annotations to the tooltips that appear in the "You are not 
	eligible for these items" window that appears when you kill bosses a second 
	time in Raid Finder runs, so you'll know how sad you should be that that axe 
	finally dropped when you can't roll on it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.17</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can now once again see someone's average equipped item level by 
	hovering over the Pawn button on the inspect window.&nbsp; (Your own 
	equipped item level is now in the General section of your stats list, even 
	without Pawn installed.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a long-standing issue where hovering over the Pawn button on the 
	inspect window could display inaccurate (too low) totals and average item 
	levels if the server hadn't sent your computer the stats for one or more of 
	the items the inspected player was wearing yet.&nbsp; (Now you know that 
	when you hover over someone at level 85 and see that their average item 
	level is 145, you know that they really<i> are</i> that much of a n00b and 
	it's not just a miscalculation.) </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.16</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Items found in the Raid Finder versions of the Dragon Soul raid will no 
	longer appear with an unnecessary (?) icon.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.15</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When you delete a character and then create a new character with the 
	same name but a different class, Pawn will now automatically hide the 
	Wowhead scales from the old class and show the Wowhead scales for the new 
	class.</li>
	<li>Corrected the display of the item you're upgrading in the loot upgrade 
	advisor.&nbsp; (Since 4.2 it would say things like "25% upgrade vs. 
	ff00ff00Your Old Item".)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.14</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added in the new epic gems available in WoW patch 4.3.&nbsp; (You can't 
	see them when you're on a 4.2 realm.)</li>
	<li>Corrected a few calculation errors for Guardian's Demonseye, Jagged 
	Dream Emerald, and Lightning Jasper.</li>
	<li>Hid the equipped average item level information from the Pawn tooltip 
	when on WoW 4.3 
	since that's now available on the character sheet without needing Pawn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.13</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the value of the stats portion of meta sockets ("Meta: 
	stats") was being drastically overvalued (the "Meta: effect" value was being 
	included as well).</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where it wasn't possible to manually override a value for 
	prismatic sockets.</li>
	<li>Possibly worked around an error that some people were receiving 
	("attempt to index field 'UnenchantedStats' (a nil value)") that may have 
	been related to Enchantrix or tekKompare.&nbsp; (I'm not sure because I was 
	never able to reproduce it myself.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.12</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added updated Wowhead scales for all classes and specs, significantly 
	updated for patch 4.2.&nbsp; (For example, the new scales for plate tanks no 
	longer include agility.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added Pawn tooltip support to the encounter journal loot lists in patch 
	4.2.&nbsp; (This doesn't add upgrade arrows next to the items yet; the 
	upgrade arrows will be on the tooltips themselves.)</li>
	<li>Removed the unnecessary (?) that appeared on honor and conquest gear 
	next to "Season 9".</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where one-handed caster weapons (not main hand weapons; 
	pretty much just Amani Scepter of Rites) would show up as massive upgrades 
	for your off-hand slot even though you couldn't actually put the item there.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Items that bind to your Battle.net account will no longer get (?) icons 
	on them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue where Fierce Ember Topaz would be improperly suggested or 
	not suggested for socketing.&nbsp; (Calculations were still correct.)</li>
	<li>Added support for the three new Shadowspirit Diamond cuts that were 
	added in patch 4.0.6.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the Gems tab would not show any gems if you were level 
	81+ didn't have two primary professions (wtf).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Upgrades that are less than half of a percent better than your current 
	gear will no longer be shown as upgrades.</li>
	<li>Fixed an annoying bug in 1.5.6 that was causing some people to get a lot 
	of errors (&quot;attempt to compare number with nil&quot;) and was causing upgrade 
	tracking features to not work properly for rings.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that would occur when hovering over the Pawn button on your character sheet
	if your computer hadn't downloaded information about your equipped items yet.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue with a couple Nightstones being improperly suggested for 
	socketing.&nbsp; (Calculations involving those gems were still correct.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I added back a &quot;Show both current and base values&quot; option since some 
	people just couldn&#39;t live without it.&nbsp; <i>(...you whiners. :)</i></li>
	<li>Pawn&#39;s now smarter about what it considers as upgrades for heirloom 
	items.&nbsp; Heirloom weapons currently scale from level 1 to 80, so when 
	you&#39;re level 1 to 79, Pawn won&#39;t consider other weapons to be upgrades, but 
	when you hit level 80 it will start suggesting upgrades again.&nbsp; 
	Heirloom chests currently scale from level 1 to 80 so Pawn will work 
	similarly, but they give an XP boost until you hit level 81, so Pawn won&#39;t 
	start suggesting upgrades for your chest until you hit level 81.&nbsp; Once 
	you hit the level cap (85 if you have Cataclysm) then it will ignore 
	heirloom-ness for purposes of tracking upgrades.</li>
	<li>Updated the Wowhead stat weights for all warrior specs, holy and protection paladin, marksman hunter, holy priest, elemental shaman, all mage specs, and balance and resto druid.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a new per-scale option (on by default) that causes Pawn to never 
	consider armor that your class doesn&#39;t specialize in as an upgrade after your 
	character hits level 50.&nbsp; (For example, with the option on, a holy 
	paladin wearing crappy quest green plate that sees the most awesome epic mail healing 
	pants <em>evar</em> will still not see that item as an upgrade since it 
	would break the +5% intellect bonus for wearing only plate.)&nbsp; To change 
	this option, go to the Values tab, choose a scale, scroll down to the list 
	or armor types and click one, and then check the option that appears.</li>
	<li>Added new options to disable each of the Pawn advisors (loot upgrade 
	advisor, quest upgrade advisor, socketing advisor, and reforging advisor) 
	individually.</li>
	<li>Added a new option to no longer color the borders of tooltips for items 
	that are upgrades.&nbsp; (This is useful if you also use TipTac or just 
	really don&#39;t like that feature.)</li>
	<li>Added proper support for items with prismatic sockets (which will no 
	longer appear in the UI as red sockets) and cogwheel sockets (which were 
	previously ignored).</li>
	<li>The best cogwheels for each of your scales will now be listed on the 
	Gems tab when you&#39;re on an engineer of level 81 or higher.</li>
	<li>Included a bunch of new patch-4.0-friendly scales from Wowhead.</li>
	<li>The &quot;show current item values&quot; and &quot;show base item values&quot; options are 
	now gone.&nbsp; Base values are always shown, and current values are never 
	shown.<ul>
		<li>Update: I added this feature back in version 1.5.6.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The Pawn UI now closes when you press the Escape key.</li>
	<li>Hovering over the Pawn button on your character sheet will now list both 
	the average item level of your gear as well as the &quot;epic item level&quot; that it 
	did in the past.&nbsp; Pawn&#39;s epic item level number factors item rarity 
	into the value; the average item level ignores the rarity of the item and 
	will yield numbers that are more comparable to the ones you see in-game, 
	such as the Looking for Dungeon interface.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the socket values for Wowhead scales that aren&#39;t 
	visible on your character&#39;s tooltips (such as the ones for other classes) 
	were getting socket values calculated that were far too low.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where exported scales didn&#39;t include the quality of meta 
	gems to use.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where item recipes taught by a profession trainer would have 
	unnecessary (?) annotations.</li>
	<li>Fixed a minor display issue that occurred in the Loot Upgrade Advisor when a massive upgrade dropped 
	in a dungeon run.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Quest Upgrade Advisor will now put a question mark (?) icon on 
	trinkets.</li>
	<li>You can now show and hide scales by shift-clicking on their name in the 
	scale list.&nbsp; (Maybe this will help all those people who can&#39;t seem to 
	find the &quot;show scale in tooltips&quot; checkbox...)</li>
	<li>Added support for the dodge rating on the new Cataclysm head enchantment for tanks.</li>
	<li>When you copy a built-in (Wowhead) scale, the built-in scale will now be 
	automatically hidden.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you right-click an NPC who has a quest with some 
	items you&#39;ve never seen before and some that you have, Pawn would sometimes 
	display incorrect upgrade/vendor information.&nbsp; (Unfortunately, this 
	happens a lot when leveling.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where some reforged items were getting a few extra points in 
	their values for their reforging potential, which shouldn&#39;t happen since you 
	can&#39;t reforge an item a second time without restoring the original item 
	first.</li>
	<li>Updated stat weights from Wowhead for some rogue, death knight, and 
	shaman specs have been included.</li>
	<li>Added more detail to the &quot;Show item IDs&quot; option, which isn&#39;t too useful 
	to most people.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a nasty bug where sometimes hotkeyed spells and abilities would 
	stop working after using the reforging or item socketing UI.</li>
	<li>The Wowhead scales for rogues will now ignore upgrades for two-handed 
	weapons (which would just be fishing poles).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can now set Pawn to hide upgrades for your one-handed weapon set and 
	your two-handed weapon on a per-scale basis.&nbsp; To change this setting, 
	go to the Values tab, select the scale you want to modify, and then find 
	either a one-handed or two-handed weapon in the list of weapon types, and 
	the new option will appear.&nbsp; (The option will not be visible for weapon 
	types that you cannot equip, such as daggers for paladins.)<ul>
		<li>For example, even though paladin tanks can use two-handed weapons, a 
		two-handed weapon is never an &quot;upgrade&quot; for a paladin tanking set, so 
		you can turn off upgrade notifications for them.&nbsp; Similarly, 
		retribution paladins can use one-handed weapons, but they are never 
		upgrades.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The amount by which you can increase an item&#39;s score through reforging 
	is now shown on the Compare tab as &quot;Reforge potential,&quot; and is now 
	automatically added to the score of an item.<ul>
		<li>This is consistent with how Pawn treats empty sockets—the assumption 
		is that if you care about the item you will gem and reforge it properly.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Added a new stat, &quot;Off-hand frill,&quot; which applies to all &quot;held in off 
	hand&quot; caster items, and not off-hand weapons.</li>
	<li>The Compare tab will now also show the percentage increase in the score 
	of the better item in addition to the score difference.</li>
	<li>Cloaks will no longer be counted as cloth items, so scales that have 
	&quot;items with this are unusable&quot; set for cloth armor will now get values for 
	cloaks.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the item link window could have a green border when it 
	shouldn&#39;t.</li>
	<li>Fixed an error that could sometimes occur when adding off-hand items to 
	the Compare tab using keyboard shortcuts.</li>
	<li>Low-level items with elemental spell damage (&quot;of Fiery Wrath&quot; and so on) 
	will now be treated as if they had spell power, rather than having a 
	specific unique stat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added the Reforging Advisor, which suggests the way to modify an item 
	that will maximize its value when you&#39;re visiting an Arcane Reforger.<ul>
		<li>Be careful when reforging hit rating and expertise; if you adjust 
		your scales to reduce the value of those stats when you&#39;re at or near 
		the cap, Pawn will determine that the item&#39;s value would be maximized if 
		you reforged the hit or expertise into something else, which may take 
		you below the cap.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Cataclysm gem cuts are now available on the Gems tab, including many 
	that weren&#39;t available in beta.&nbsp; To update your scales to use the new 
	gems, just select them from the lists on the Gems tab.&nbsp; (This is a 
	per-scale setting.)</li>
	<li>The upgrade annotations on weapons will now show which weapon set (1H or 
	2H) the item is upgrading so it&#39;s more clear that, for example, some random 
	green dagger isn&#39;t better than Shadowmourne; it&#39;s just better than your 
	skinning knife.</li>
	<li>Prismatic sockets on relic items will now get a proper value.&nbsp; 
	(Pawn will treat them as red sockets, but since there are no socket bonuses, 
	it won&#39;t really matter—Pawn will assume that you will socket the best gem of any color when 
	calculating the value.)</li>
	<li>If any of the reward choices for a quest is a trinket, Pawn will now 
	never show the coins (highest vendor price) icon on any item for that quest 
	so you aren&#39;t as likely to accidentally take a useless item if there&#39;s a 
	nice trinket available.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn now tells you when an item you&#39;re looking at is an upgrade to your 
	current best gear for a particular scale.<ul>
		<li>Pawn scans your equipped items and all of your Equipment Manager 
		sets to find your best items for each of your scales.</li>
		<li>Tooltips of items that are better than the best item of the same 
		type will get an upgrade icon and have an upgrade percentage listed.<ul>
			<li>Trinkets are ignored since they have special effects that Pawn 
			can&#39;t value that drastically affect their usefulness.</li>
			<li>For rings, items that are better than your <em>second</em>-best 
			ring will be shown as an upgrade.</li>
			<li>Items can be an upgrade for multiple scales simultaneously.&nbsp; 
			For example, if you had a &quot;healing throughput&quot; scale and a &quot;healing 
			regen&quot; scale, a nice new healing weapon might be better than your 
			current weapon for both of those scales.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>You can easily compare items against your current best-in-slot items 
		using new buttons added to the Compare tab.</li>
		<li>Pawn currently assumes that you&#39;ll want to keep a two-hander around 
		as well as two one-handers, so upgrades for either set are 
		handled independently.&nbsp; This can create some odd situations; for 
		example, a shaman with no interest in two-handed weapons at all will see 
		most two-handed weapons as a potential upgrade.<ul>
			<li>If you want to avoid this, you can set the two-handed weapon 
			stats (&quot;Axe: 2H,&quot; &quot;Polearm,&quot; etc.) to Ignored on the Values tab for 
			your scale(s).&nbsp; You can&#39;t make changes to the built-in Wowhead 
			scales directly, so you&#39;d have to make a copy of the scale first, 
			hide the Wowhead one, and then modify your copy.&nbsp; I&#39;ll look 
			into ways of making this less stupid in future versions.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The new upgrade features can be turned off entirely from the Options 
		tab if you find them annoying.</li>
		<li>Added the Quest Upgrade Advisor, which adds an arrow icon next to quest 
	rewards that are upgrades for you, or if none of the rewards are good, adds 
	a coins icon next to the reward that will vendor for the most money.</li>
		<li>Added the Loot Upgrade Advisor, which adds a popup window next to 
		the roll window when an item drops that is an upgrade for you.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The default behavior has changed so that Pawn only modifies tooltips of 
	items that are upgrades.&nbsp; Existing Pawn users will probably want to 
	change the &quot;Show upgrades on tooltips&quot; option to &quot;Show scale values and upgrade %.&quot;</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem that appeared in patch 4.0.3 where haste and resilience 
	rating on items was not being recognized.</li>
	<li>Quest rewards shown on the world map will now have Pawn values shown on 
	them.</li>
	<li>&quot;Currently equipped&quot; tooltips attached to the item link window will now 
	have Pawn values shown on them.</li>
	<li>Added a new &quot;stat&quot; for all off-hand weapons.&nbsp; The Wowhead scales 
	for specs that can&#39;t use off-hand weapons have that stat ignored. </li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in Pawn&#39;s item score cache that was causing unnecessary 
	slowdowns when Pawn needed to calculate several values at once, such as when 
	hovering over the Pawn button on your character sheet, or when &quot;currently 
	equipped&quot; tooltips are visible.</li>
	<li>Scales can no longer mark the weapon speed &quot;stat&quot; as ignored.</li>
	<li>Updated the Wowhead scales to add a placeholder value for mastery 
	rating.</li>
	<li>Updated the value of spirit in the Wowhead shadow priest scale to the 
	levels of hit rating due to the Twisted Faith talent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.4.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will no longer put a (?) next to &quot;Reforged&quot; on reforged items.</li>
	<li>Spell penetration is once again properly recognized on items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now suggest gems based on the colors and cuts available in 
	patch 4.0.</li>
	<li>The new Cataclysm gem cuts (as well as the old Burning Crusade 
	cuts) are available in Pawn&#39;s Gems tab.&nbsp; You can select them using the 
	dropdown lists at the top.&nbsp; (As before, you can choose a different 
	quality of gems for each of your scales.)&nbsp; The Cataclysm cuts are not 
	visible unless on the Cataclysm beta.</li>
	<li>The built-in Wowhead scales have been adjusted somewhat for patch 4.0.&nbsp; 
	Hopefully they should better reflect updated class mechanics in 4.0, but 
	they do not currently match the stat weights on Wowhead exactly.&nbsp; If you have suggestions, please see
	<a href="http://cata.wowhead.com/forums&topic=169544&p=2315094">this thread 
	on the Wowhead theorycrafting forums</a>.</li>
	<li>Many stats have been removed from items and are thus also removed from 
	Pawn.&nbsp; Your existing scales will be automatically converted to take 
	this into account:<ul>
		<li>The following stats will be removed from scales entirely since they 
		were removed from items: armor penetration, defense rating, block value, 
		block rating, ranged attack power, and all forms of single-school spell 
		damage.</li>
		<li>If the scale contains a value for MP5 and its value for Spirit is 
		less than half of the scale&#39;s value for MP5, Spirit will be raised to 
		that amount.&nbsp; MP5 is removed from scales.&nbsp; MP5 still appears 
		on socket bonuses for a few healer items; those socket bonuses will be 
		considered to have 2 Spirit per 1 MP5 for purposes of calculations.</li>
		<li>The druid concept of &quot;feral attack power&quot; no longer exists, so the 
		fake Feral AP stat has been removed from Pawn as well.&nbsp; Be sure to 
		add weapon DPS to scales to compensate.</li>
		<li>The following stats have been removed from scales because they are 
		very rare: Health per 5, raw mana, and raw health.&nbsp; Items or 
		enchantments with these rare stats will be instead considered to have 
		points in base stats (Stamina, Intellect) for purposes of calculations.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.12</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A bunch of new fixes to make Pawn work on the Cataclysm beta and the 4.0 
	PTRs.&nbsp; This version also works fine on live realms.<ul>
		<li>Mastery rating now works again.</li>
		<li>The problem where Pawn would hang after scanning approximately 50 
		items has been resolved.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an embarrassing typo that caused staves and polearms to not get 
	Pawn values for classes that cannot also use two-handed swords, axes, and 
	maces (everyone but warriors, I guess?).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Stats with negative values will no longer be taken into account when normalizing 
	item values.&nbsp; (For example, if a scale is Stamina = 10, Intellect = 5, 
	Spirit = -10, then all values for that scale will be divided by 15, not 5.)</li>
	<li>You can now mark stats as &quot;unusable.&quot;&nbsp; Items that have that stat on 
	them will get no value for that scale.&nbsp; For example, a scale for 
	shamans can mark plate as unusable, and then all plate armor will get no 
	value for that scale since shamans can&#39;t wear it.</li>
	<li>The built-in scales now take advantage of the unusable stats feature, so 
	unequippable items will not receive values.&nbsp; (Your character&#39;s current 
	level is not taken into account for this, so for example low-level shamans 
	and hunters will still get values on mail items even though they can&#39;t wear 
	mail until level 40.)</li>
	<li>There are now separate stats for the one-handed and two-handed versions 
	of axes, maces, and swords.&nbsp; Existing scales that had a value for those 
	weapon types will now only have a value for the one-handed version of those 
	weapon types and will need to be updated manually.</li>
	<li>Hopefully fixed the bug that a few people were seeing where they sometimes could 
	not select scales.&nbsp; I finally ran into it myself and tried an 
	on-the-spot fix that worked for me.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Improved the appearance of the Pawn UI.&nbsp; It&#39;s now no longer 
	translucent, so it should be easier to read the text in certain 
	circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Implemented additional performance enhancements so that Pawn uses even 
	less memory and CPU time.&nbsp; Having the Wowhead scales loaded now 
	increases Pawn&#39;s memory and CPU usage by only a negligible amount, so I 
	don&#39;t recommend disabling them anymore.</li>
	<li>Added an arrow icon to the best item shown on the Compare tab to make it 
	clearer at a glance and for colorblind people.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where Pawn wouldn&#39;t recalculate which gems were best for a 
	scale after chanigng stat values until the next time you logged in.</li>
	<li>Fixed a separate bug where sometimes the display of socket values that 
	were calculated automatically (as opposed to manually set) would not display 
	correctly, even if they were properly calculated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Thanks to some gnomish performance engineering, Pawn now uses about 95% 
	less CPU time during login, which should reduce your login times by a second 
	or two.</li>
	<li>Added a new scale from Wowhead for arms warriors.</li>
	<li>Changed the (*) warning message to be a little clearer, and now it has a 
	new (?) icon.&nbsp; Pawn now calls item properties that it doesn&#39;t recognize 
	&quot;special effects.&quot;</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the item special effect warning message wasn&#39;t showing up 
	even when enabled.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that might occur after the Wowhead scales (or any 
	scales from a &quot;plugin&quot; of any sort) were disabled by deleting 
	Wowhead.lua.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Changed a bunch of text to make it even easier for new users to get 
	started with Pawn.</li>
	<li>The default for new users of Pawn is now to only show the base values of 
	items.&nbsp; If you&#39;re already using Pawn and have current item values 
	shown, your settings won&#39;t be changed and you&#39;ll still see both numbers.</li>
	<li>Rearranged the list of stats on the Values tab so that more common stats 
	are easier to find, and really rare stats like raw health aren&#39;t wasting 
	prime screen real estate.</li>
	<li>Added support for items with mastery rating for those of you in the 
	Cataclysm beta.&nbsp; (Untested.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue for patch 3.3.5 that prevented you from linking gems from 
	the Gems tab.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a very small value for Stamina for Wowhead scales that did not 
	already include Stamina.&nbsp; This will help prevent certain very odd gems 
	from appearing as suggestions in the Gems tab.&nbsp; (For example, some DPS 
	scales did not include values for any blue stat, so the ret pally Gems tab 
	included a gem with Spirit!)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where Pawn disabled the Blizzard UI&#39;s item comparison 
	tooltip that appears when you hold down the shift key while your mouse is 
	over an item link window.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the Export button would generate an invalid scale tag 
	for the Wowhead scales.&nbsp; Now you can properly export the Wowhead scales 
	just like your own.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the Pawn socketing suggestions window would not show 
	the proper name of Wowhead scales.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3</h3>
<p><strong>Important!&nbsp; </strong>After upgrading to Pawn 
	1.3, your Pawn settings and scales will be upgraded and will no longer be 
visible in older versions of Pawn.&nbsp; If you need to revert to an older version of Pawn, 
use the new /pawn backup command to make a backup copy of your scales that you 
can save in a file on your computer.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can now see and edit all of your scales in the Pawn UI, regardless 
	of which character you&#39;re currently on.&nbsp; (You&#39;ll need to log into 
	each of your characters once first.)&nbsp; Each of your scales can be 
	shown in tooltips for just one or none of your characters (like in previous 
	versions), or you can have a scale show up in the tooltips for multiple 
	different characters.</li>
	<li>All of the stat weight presets from Wowhead are now included with Pawn, 
	so you can immediately start using it without needing to import or create 
	any scales if you don&#39;t feel like customizing.&nbsp; The Wowhead scales 
	can&#39;t be changed, but if you want to use them as a starting point for your 
	own scales you can copy them and modify the copy.<ul>
		<li>If you have feedback for the Wowhead scales, please see the
		<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?forums&amp;board=20" target="_blank">
		Wowhead Theorycrafting forum</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The new Scale tab now contains most of the per-scale options (such as 
	whether it shows up on your character&#39;s tooltips), as well as the options 
	for importing, exporting, and creating scales.&nbsp; The Values tab 
	(previously the Scales tab) is now a bit simpler.</li>
	<li>The list of scales now appears in a pane to the left of the Pawn UI instead of in 
	a dropdown.&nbsp; The scales that are visible on the current character&#39;s 
	tooltips will appear at the top of the list.</li>
	<li>The &quot;Normalize values (like Wowhead)&quot; option can now be set individually 
	for each of your scales for finer control.</li>
	<li>Added a new command <strong>/pawn backup</strong> that you can use to 
	back up all of your custom scales at once as a big mass of scale tags.</li>
	<li>Item levels will now only appear on items in the Compare tab if you also 
	have them enabled for item tooltips in Interface Options.</li>
	<li>If you hold down the Shift key when clicking the Delete button to delete 
	a scale, the scale will now be deleted immediately without requiring 
	confirmation.</li>
	<li>Many bugs were fixed, including several bugs that only existed in 
	pre-release versions of Pawn 1.3 and are not listed here:<ul>
		<li>Fixed a potential error when setting up default Pawn keybindings when using Pawn for the first time for a 
	character, and added a 
	diagnostic message to help determine why the problem is occurring.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug where often the first item comparison you performed in the 
	Compare tab wouldn&#39;t show item values until you clicked the Swap button or 
	the list of scales.</li>
		<li>Fixed the error that would occur when trying to put an heirloom item in 
	the Compare tab.</li>
		<li>Fixed a display issue where scales with colons (&#39;:&#39;) in their names 
		would appear incorrectly on tooltips if the &quot;align values to right edge 
		of tooltip&quot; option were enabled.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug where the scale total values listed when hovering over a 
	Pawn button on someone&#39;s character sheet weren&#39;t listed in alphabetical order.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>What used to be called the enchanted value of an item is now the current 
	value, and what used to be called the unenchanted value is now the base 
	value.&nbsp; The word &quot;base&quot; now also appears on tooltips.&nbsp; (No functionality has changed; this is just a terminology 
	change.)</li>
	<li>Fixed the error that occurred when hovering over Brewfest steins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an error that occurred when hovering over profession recipes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can now select what quality of gems to use for each of your scales 
	on the Gems tab: uncommon, rare, or epic.&nbsp; Each scale can have a 
	different quality level, so your main spec scale can use epic gems, and your 
	offspec scale can use rare gems.</li>
	<li>By popular request, enchanted values of items now no longer include any 
	points for sockets on the item, since the enchanted value is meant to 
	reflect the current state of the item.&nbsp; This means that before you put 
	gems in an item, the enchanted value of an item will be lower than the 
	unenchanted value.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where occasionally items that weren&#39;t enchanted would show 
	two equal values, such as &quot;123.4 (123.4)&quot;.&nbsp; (This was only a display 
	issue; the values were being calculated properly.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now calculate correct socket values if you have the &quot;normalize 
	values (like Wowhead)&quot; option enabled.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed the &quot;attempt to perform arithmetic on field &#39;?&#39; (a nil value)&quot; 
	error that some users were experiencing in Pawn 1.2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Note:</b> Upon installation, this version of Pawn will automatically make adjustments to 
	each of your
scales&#39; socket values.&nbsp; To avoid this, you can turn off the option for each 
	scale to always correctly match gem colors.</li>
	<li>By default, Pawn will automatically choose the best rare-quality level 
	80 gem of each color and use the value of that gem when calculating item 
	values.&nbsp; Most people will no longer ever need to manually set values 
	for red, yellow, or blue sockets.</li>
	<li>There&#39;s now a new Gems tab in the Pawn UI.&nbsp; This tab shows you the 
	best rare-quality level 80 gems that are available for any of your scales.&nbsp; 
	Never again will you wonder which gems to have cut for that new boss drop.
	<ul>
		<li>The Gems tab also displays suggested meta gems, but take these with a grain of
		salt; Pawn ignores the special effects on the gem.</li>
		<li>The Gems tab only considers rare-quality level 80 gems.&nbsp; I&#39;ll 
		add support for epic gems very soon in an upcoming Pawn update.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Pawn will now add a tooltip to the item socketing window displaying the 
	suggested gems to use when socketing that item for each of your scales.&nbsp; 
	In addition, the window now has a Pawn button that takes you directly to the 
	Gems tab for more details.</li>
	<li>Meta sockets are now covered by two values instead of one: the old "Meta socket" value
	is now "Meta: stats" and covers the normal stat bonuses from meta gems.  The
	new value is "Meta: effect" and covers the bonus effects from meta gems.  Helms with an
	empty meta socket will get the values from both added to their totals.  Helms with a
	filled meta socket will get the values of Meta: effect and the actual stats on the gem added
	to their totals.  This reflects the fact that stat-for-stat, helms with meta sockets are clearly
	better than helms without them because of the added effects that meta gems bring.</li>
	<li>Adjusted the value of MP5 in the default scale to correspond with current itemization.</li>
	<li>Removed the Pawn feature to show item levels, as it is now built into the game.</li>
	<li>Fixed the &quot;Could not parse the item link&quot; error that appeared when 
	clicking the links that items such as the Titanium Seal of Dalaran and Worn 
	Troll Dice add to chat.</li>
	<li>Corrected the display of socket bonuses on weapons in the Compare tab.</li>
	<li>(English) Enchant Boots: Greater Vitality now works again.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.13</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed the "attempt to perform arithmetic on local 'Dps&#39; (a nil value)&quot; 
	issue introduced by 1.1.12 relating to feral attack power calculations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.12</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Though it doesn&#39;t actually exist as a real weapon stat anymore, druids 
	can once again assign a value to feral attack power instead of weapon DPS if 
	they don&#39;t like multiplying by 14.</li>
	<li>Updated Outfitter support to handle newer versions of Outfitter.&nbsp; 
	(If alternate outfit tooltips stop working for you, be sure to download the 
	latest version of Outfitter too.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When &quot;show item levels&quot; is enabled, you can now hover over the Pawn 
	button on your character sheet or an inspected player&#39;s character sheet to 
	get an estimate of that player&#39;s average item level in epic gear.&nbsp; For 
	example, an epic gear level of 200 means that the player is in full 10-man 
	Naxxramas gear; 213 means that the player is in full 25-man Naxxramas gear.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for Pawn values on Outfitter alternate-outfit tooltips.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where scales that used to have a value for colorless sockets 
	back when Pawn included them as a possible stat would show inaccurate values 
	if you had normalization turned on.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where armor penetration gems (like Fractured Scarlet Ruby) 
	didn&#39;t work in the English version.</li>
	<li>Added support for Titanium Plating and Enchant Weapon: Accuracy.</li>
	<li>Minor updates for colorblind mode in patch 3.1.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Removed the feral attack power stat entirely since it no longer exists 
	directly on weapons.&nbsp; (Feral druids should increase their value for 
	weapon DPS accordingly.)</li>
	<li>Added compatibility with the mod tdItemTip.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>One more potential fix for the error that I worked on in the last 
	version.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue where Pawn would in rare situations cause an error when it was 
	loaded for the first time for a character (either a new character, or a 
	character new to Pawn).&nbsp; Whether or not a given person would actually 
	experience this bug is essentially random.&nbsp; This is also reported to 
	have worked around game crashes that a few people were seeing.</li>
	<li>Added support for Enchant Boots: Greater Vitality, and the hit rating 
	effect of Titanium Weapon Chain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Feral druids and death knights rejoice!&nbsp; You can now assign 
	separate values to base armor (on cloth, cloaks, leather, mail, and plate) and bonus 
	armor (on weapons, trinkets, necklaces, rings, and enchantments).<ul>
		<li>Please note that pre-Wrath items that had bonus armor (in green 
		text) will have the full armor value reported as base armor even though 
		some is bonus armor.&nbsp; There is currently no way for mods to tell 
		the difference.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Updated the default values for the socket stats to more appropriate 
	values, assuming that you would use level 80 blue gems in them.&nbsp; Existing 
	scales will not be changed.</li>
	<li>Support for colorless / prismatic sockets added by blacksmithing has 
	been removed.&nbsp; Since these sockets never appear on items normally, and 
	they are simply an interim stage (you&#39;d never socket an item and then decide 
	not to put a gem in it), I decided it didn&#39;t make sense to assign values to 
	them. </li>
	<li>The red text that appears after socketed jewelcrafter-only BoP gems that 
	says that they require jewelcrafting will no longer appear with an asterisk 
	(*).</li>
	<li>Added support for Enchant Boots: Icewalker.</li>
	<li>Worked around a bug that could cause the Compare tab to stop working in 
	certain situations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where, on the Compare tab, meta sockets would appear under 
	the &quot;socket bonus&quot; heading instead of the &quot;sockets&quot; heading.</li>
	<li>Enchantments that are on enchanters&#39; rings when you are not an enchanter 
	(the ones that appear in red) will no longer appear with asterisks (*).</li>
	<li>Armor penetration rating on new Wrath of the Lich King items will now be 
	interpreted correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This is the patch 3.0 version of Pawn, and will not work properly on WoW 
	2.4.x.&nbsp; The stats Spell damage, Healing, Spell hit rating, Spell crit 
	rating, and Spell haste rating have all been removed.&nbsp; Spell damage and 
	Healing have been replaced with Spell power, and the three Spell combat 
	ratings have been combined into hybrid ratings that work for both casters 
	and non-casters.&nbsp; Pawn will update your scales automatically, but you 
	might want to check the values of those stats to make sure that they are in 
	line with what you&#39;d expect.</li>
	<li>Added stats that allow you to assign different values to different armor 
	types (such as plate, cloth, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for account-bound (gold-quality) items and more new things that appear in 
	WoW 3.0.</li>
	<li>Fixed an error message that could appear when using some item links from 
	sites like Wowhead.</li>
	<li>Armor penetration works once more on WoW 3.0.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed Link Wrangler compatibility, which was broken in Pawn 1.1.</li>
	<li>Items that have at least one recognized stat (normally marked with an 
	asterisk) will be marked as such in the Compare tab.&nbsp; (This feature 
	existed in 1.1 betas but did not appear in the final version.)</li>
	<li>Added support for Lake Wintergrasp items and the Scourgestone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This version of Pawn has been tested on both the live realms and on the Wrath of 
the Lich King beta, and includes <i>tons</i> of fixes to make Pawn work 
	correctly on Wrath servers, and to support new stats and types of items that 
	appear in the expansion content, including new stats, new gems, encrypted 
	items, colorless sockets, and more.</li>
	<li>Pawn now sports a new tab, Compare, which lets you see two items 
	side-by-side to compare their stats in more detail.&nbsp; Check it out!<ul>
		<li>You can compare any two items in your inventory or a merchant&#39;s 
		inventory by dropping them in 
		the slots.</li>
		<li>If the left slot is empty and you drop an item in the right slot, 
		your currently equipped item will automatically be put in the left slot.</li>
		<li>In addition to dragging and dropping items, all of the following 
		shortcuts also work:<ul>
			<li>Clicking either of the &quot;currently equipped&quot; shortcut buttons 
			that appear in the lower-left corner once there is an item in the 
			right slot.</li>
			<li>Hovering over an item in your inventory, another player&#39;s 
			inventory, a vendor&#39;s inventory, an item link window, AtlasLoot, or 
			other locations, and pressing the &quot;[&quot; or 
			&quot;]&quot; key.&nbsp; (This key binding is customizable in the regular key 
			bindings interface.)</li>
			<li>You can also right-click item link windows and item icons in 
			loot roll windows to immediately compare the item with your 
			currently equipped item.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The first time you run Pawn after upgrading to 1.1, Pawn will 
	automatically bind keys to its commands if you aren&#39;t using those keys for 
	other things.&nbsp; By default, &quot;P&quot; will open and close the Pawn UI, and &quot;[&quot; 
	and &quot;]&quot; are used for item comparisons.&nbsp; If 
	you later unbind those keys or bind them to other actions, Pawn won&#39;t try to 
	rebind them.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where Pawn values didn&#39;t show up on item link windows if you 
	only had unenchanted numbers visible, not enchanted numbers.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where error text would appear in the chat window when 
	hovering over recipes in Ackis Recipe List and possibly other similar mods.</li>
	<li>German users rejoice!&nbsp; When entering stat values you can now use a 
	comma instead of a period as a decimal separator—for example, &quot;0,5&quot; now 
	works in addition to &quot;0.5&quot;.</li>
	<li>In this version of Pawn, I&#39;ve significantly reorganized a lot of the code that reads 
	and annotates item tooltips.&nbsp; This, coupled with other changes in Wrath 
	of the Lich King, is likely to cause some conflicts with other mods.&nbsp; 
	If you run into problems with Pawn, please remember to try to reproduce the 
	same problem with no other item-related mods installed.&nbsp; I still may be 
	able to fix the bug if it turns out that the bug is related to another mod, 
	but I need to know <i>which</i> mod to download and try.</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug that would prevent Pawn from working properly if one or
	more of your scales didn't assign a value to the spell damage stat.</li>
	<li>Updated the value of the armor penetration and spell penetration stats 
	in the default Pawn scale to match current itemization.&nbsp; Existing 
	scales are not changed.</li>
	<li>Pawn will no longer try to assign a default value to spell damage (WoW 2.4) if you use
	a scale that contains only spell power (WoW 3.0).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added an entry in the Interface Options dialog to launch the Pawn UI, in 
	case you hide the Pawn button and forget how to get it back.</li>
	<li>You can now assign a value to the Wrath of the Lich King &quot;spell power&quot; 
	stat to your scales.&nbsp; It uses the same values by default as the &quot;spell 
	power&quot; stat in Pawn 0.7.4, and your existing scales will be assigned a value 
	for the stat automatically.&nbsp; Your scales will still have spell damage 
	and healing stats in them, but they won&#39;t be used for anything.</li>
	<li>In Wrath of the Lich King, the stats that currently appear as melee hit 
	rating, melee crit rating, and melee haste will also apply to spells, and 
	the spell hit, crit, and haste rating stats are not used.&nbsp; Existing 
	scales will not be modified at this time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When Armory is installed, added support for showing unenchanted values 
	on the item comparison tooltips that appear when holding down the Alt key.</li>
	<li>Added support for the stat-only components of Surefooted, Cat&#39;s 
	Swiftness, and Boar&#39;s Speed.&nbsp; (The run speed and snare resistance 
	effects are ignored since there are no Pawn stats for those.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you clicked a link for an item that had an icon and 
	then a link for a spell that did not have an icon, the item&#39;s icon would not 
	properly disappear.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug with reading certain items with multiple stats on the same 
	line that was causing problems with the French translation in progress.</li>
	<li>Removed a bunch more asterisks from various items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s now possible to force Pawn to always calculate an item&#39;s value 
	based on the correct color of gems (Pawn 0.8 and older behavior) instead of 
	maximizing the item&#39;s value by potentially using the wrong colors and 
	ignoring the socket bonus (Pawn 0.9 and later behavior).&nbsp; To change the 
	option for one of your scales, choose that scale in the UI and then choose 
	one of the colored sockets from the stat list.</li>
	<li>Added support for socket bonuses (and possible future gems) that give 
	melee haste rating.</li>
	<li>Added shaman healing scales based on the popular Elitist Jerks thread to 
	the sample scales document that comes with Pawn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Restored compatibility with Link Wrangler, which stopped working in Pawn 0.9.</li>
	<li>Added support for showing Pawn values on Link Wrangler&#39;s &quot;compare 
	equipped items&quot; tooltips.</li>
	<li>Added support for showing inventory icons next to Link Wrangler 
	tooltips.</li>
	<li>There&#39;s now a &quot;getting started&quot; tab to gently remind new users to read 
	the Readme file.</li>
	<li>Takes advantage of new WoW 2.4 functionality to show inventory icons 
	next to item link windows in a few situations where it couldn&#39;t before.</li>
	<li>Various other UI and text tweaks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn is now smarter about the way that it values sockets and socket 
	bonuses, which in some cases will slightly change the values of certain 
	items, both with and without gems.<ul>
		<li>If you&#39;ve already filled all of the sockets on an item and you don&#39;t 
		qualify for the socket bonus, Pawn no longer counts the socket bonus 
		stats, since they&#39;re not actually there.</li>
		<li>If you can get a better value by socketing the wrong colors of gems 
		and ignoring the socket bonus, Pawn will now do that when calculating 
		item values.&nbsp; (When the &quot;Show debug info&quot; option is enabled, Pawn 
		will tell you which color gems it used.)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Pawn now remembers all of the stats from several of the last items 
	you&#39;ve viewed so it doesn&#39;t have to always recalculate them.&nbsp; This 
	should help your framerate when rapidly hovering over many items in 
	succession, especially when an equip compare mod is also installed.</li>
	<li>You now have to type the word &quot;delete&quot; to confirm that you really want 
	to delete a scale.</li>
	<li>You can now make a copy of an existing scale by clicking the new Copy 
	button.</li>
	<li>There is now an option to hide a specific scale from tooltips without 
	having to delete it (and, most likely, export it and paste it somewhere for 
	safekeeping).</li>
	<li>Pawn will no longer look for stats on quest, spell, and ability links in 
	WoW 2.4.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bunch of UI bugs that occurred when deleting your last scale.</li>
	<li>Pawn no longer adds unnecessary asterisks to Black Temple instance-bound items, such as Naj&#39;entus Spine.</li>
	<li>Added support for Reckless Noble Topaz and other gems with spell haste 
	rating.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.8.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Pawn UI now displays the current Pawn version number on the last 
	tab.</li>
	<li>Pawn now supports addons that modify the Inspect window when it is first 
	shown instead of immediately upon login, such as Spyglass.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.8.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can now hover over the Pawn button on the inventory window to get a 
	grand total of the enchanted values on all of your equipped items.</li>
	<li>There is now a disabled Pawn button on the inspect window that you can 
	hover over to get totals for all of another player&#39;s equipped items.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where all on/off options that defaulted to being on (show 
	enchanted values, show unenchanted values, and show tooltip icons) would 
	automatically turn back on after logging out and back in.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where sometimes disabling enchanted values would cause 
	unenchanted values to also not be displayed.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the word &quot;Projectile&quot; on stacks of arrows would get an 
	asterisk, and their DPS would not count as ranged DPS.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where negative values would not be exported in scale tags.&nbsp; 
	(Negative stat values are most common with weapon speed.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Pawn UI now has an Options tab that you can use to set all Pawn 
	options.</li>
	<li>Almost all of the Pawn slash commands are now unnecessary, and have been 
	removed.&nbsp; You can still use /pawn to open the Pawn UI, and /pawn debug 
	is still available as well.</li>
	<li>Tooltips have been added to pretty much everything in the Pawn UI.</li>
	<li>You can use the new calculation option &quot;Normalize values&quot; to divide all of your scale values by 
	the sum of all of the numbers in the scale.&nbsp; This causes Pawn to 
	generate the same sorts of numbers that Lootzor does.&nbsp; (See the 
	appropriate section in the readme file for more details.)</li>
	<li>You can now change the text color for your scales individually from the 
	Pawn UI.&nbsp; You could, for example, make your healing scale show up in 
	white and your DPS scale show up in red.</li>
	<li>You can now bind a key to the Pawn UI.&nbsp; Look under &quot;Pawn&quot; in the 
	standard key bindings list.</li>
	<li>Added support for the Fiery Weapon enchantment; Pawn counts it as 4 dps.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where sometimes tooltip icons would not appear for items 
	that had never been in your inventory.&nbsp; (This includes most links in 
	trade chat.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you clicked on an item link for an item, and then a 
	tradeskill recipe (such as [Alchemy: Super Mana Potion]), the icon for the 
	previous item would stay since the recipe did not have one.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you had set custom colors for your scales, scales 
	would no longer always be sorted alphabetically by name on item tooltips.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn now shows inventory icons next to item link and item comparison 
	tooltips, so when someone links an item, you can also see its inventory 
	icon.&nbsp; You can turn this feature off with /pawn icons off.<ul>
		<li>This feature works with the built-in WoW functionality, as well as a 
		variety of other tooltip mods: EquipCompare, EQCompare, and MultiTips.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>When /pawn ids on is active, Pawn now displays the item IDs of all 
	applicable enchantments and gems in the tooltip as well.&nbsp; For example, 
	if looking at item 123 with no enchantment and gems 45 and 67 socketed, you 
	would see &quot;Item ID: 123:0:45:67&quot;.</li>
	<li>You can now have Pawn align item values (and IDs and levels, if those 
	options are on) along the right side of the tooltip with /pawn align numbers 
	right.&nbsp; Some people may find this easier to read; others may find it 
	more difficult.</li>
	<li>A new category of stats has been added, &quot;weapon types,&quot; which is 
	primarily useful for racial abilities and talents.<ul>
		<li>For example, orcs 
	get a passive 5 expertise bonus when using axes.&nbsp; So, you might give a 
		weapon a few bonus points just for being an axe.&nbsp; At level 70, 5 
		expertise costs 78.8 expertise rating, so you might value &quot;being an axe&quot; 
		as high as 78.8.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn plugins for FuBar and Titan Panel are now available as 
	separate downloads.&nbsp; You can get them at
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.curse.com/downloads/details/8214/">Curse</a>.</li>
	<li>The old &quot;spell power&quot; stat made sense before patch 2.3, but it was 
	particularly confusing to healers after that patch, so I&#39;ve removed it, and 
	replaced it with easier-to-understand &quot;spell damage&quot;.&nbsp; Now, 
	the healing stat only 
	includes healing, and the spell damage stat only includes spell damage.<ul>
		<li>Now, Light&#39;s Justice, which says that it increases healing by 382 
		and damage by 128, has 382 healing and 128 spell damage, exactly as 
		you&#39;d expect.</li>
		<li>Pawn will automatically upgrade your existing scales and any scale 
		tags that you import.&nbsp; Please double-check the value of the spell 
		damage stat after importing to make sure that it&#39;s what you intended, 
		as in this version Pawn does not read your mind.&nbsp; 
		The upgrade process will give correct results for typical cases (DPS 
		casters who don&#39;t care about healing; healers who valued spell power at 
		least as high as healing, as they should have), but may not give the 
		results you expect if you had a strange scale (healing but no spell 
		power).</li>
		<li>As always, the default Pawn scale has been adjusted to accommodate 
		these changes.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A new slash command /pawn enchanted has been added to let you turn off 
	the enchanted item values, showing only the unenchanted, unsocketed values 
	for items.&nbsp; (You can also use /pawn enchanted off along with /pawn 
	unenchanted off to temporarily hide all Pawn values.)&nbsp; This option may 
	not be compatible with all of your favorite tooltip mods, but it should work 
	in all cases where you currently get unenchanted item values today, which is 
	most everywhere.</li>
	<li>The Pawn button has a new, unique look, instead of being a regular red 
	WoW button.</li>
	<li>The Pawn button now appears in a more reasonable spot when the character 
	inventory window has been skinned using a mod such as Skinner.</li>
	<li>A new slash command /pawn button has been added to let you move the Pawn 
	button on the inventory window, or hide it completely.&nbsp; (If you hide 
	the button, you&#39;ll need to type /pawn to open the Pawn UI, or use the 
	Pawn plugin for FuBar or Titan Panel.)</li>
	<li>Added a new option to the /pawn asterisks slash command, /pawn asterisks 
	no text.&nbsp; Using this option is the same as /pawn asterisks auto, except 
	the &quot;* Pawn gave no value to some stats&quot; warning text is not added to 
	tooltips of items with at least one (*) unrecognized stat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a button to the inventory window to show and hide the Pawn 
	configuration UI.</li>
	<li>Pawn now supports Armory and EquipCompare working together with the &quot;/eqc 
	alt&quot; option to show comparisons with your alt&#39;s gear instead of your current 
	character&#39;s.</li>
	<li>Added support for the unusual items with negative stats, such as Kreeg&#39;s 
	Mug, which gives -10 Intellect.</li>
	<li>Added support for Braided Eternium Chain and other non-weapon items with 
	weapon damage as an equip bonus.&nbsp; It shows up as minimum damage and 
	maximum damage, but not DPS—it&#39;s not a weapon, so there&#39;s no speed, and 
	therefore no DPS.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem that would frequently show up when using Pawn with 
	CowTip, causing an error message to appear in chat when hovering over an 
	item and then an empty inventory slot.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where sometimes an open item link window would not be 
	immediately updated upon making scale changes.</li>
	<li>Minor changes to fix some issues when running a German version of Pawn 
	on the German WoW client.</li>
	<li>Updated the samples scales document with newer versions of Emmerald&#39;s 
	feral combat models and ShadowPanther&#39;s AEP model, and added scales for 
	Malan&#39;s Elitist Jerks EP for shamans.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The special weapon DPS stats now work.&nbsp; I had broken them in either 
	0.7 or 0.7.1.&nbsp; Existing scales will automatically be corrected; you 
	should not need to re-enter values for those stats.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If the item link window is open when you make changes to your Pawn 
	scales, it will now be updated immediately, so you can see how your changes 
	will affect the value of the item.</li>
	<li>Added spell hit rating and spell crit rating to the configuration UI.&nbsp; 
	(Oops!)</li>
	<li>Corrected a typo in the description of the melee and ranged crit rating 
	stat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn now has a configuration UI!&nbsp; To access it, simply type /pawn 
	in the chat box.&nbsp; (To see the help information that used to be 
	available when you typed /pawn, type /pawn help, or click the /pawn commands 
	button in the configuration UI.)&nbsp; You should no longer need to manually edit your SavedVariables files 
		to configure Pawn.</li>
		<li>The configuration UI is now the official way to make all changes to 
		your Pawn scales.&nbsp; Some of the slash commands that existed in 
		earlier versions of Pawn are gone, since they&#39;re no longer needed: /pawn 
		list, export, import, delete, rename.</li>
	<li>Eliminated that bug where sometimes unenchanted values would 
	disappear from items after a while.&nbsp; The problem seemed to be most 
	commonly linked to use of the world map, but also could occur after zoning 
	or showing the interface options window.</li>
	<li>Scales now appear in alphabetical order on item tooltips.</li>
	<li>Pawn now works with tekKompare and LootLink.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the value of resilience rating in the default Pawn 
	value scale was 0 instead of 1 as was intended.&nbsp; Scale tags that call resilience rating &quot;Resilience&quot; instead of &quot;ResilienceRating&quot; 
	will now be imported properly.</li>
	<li>The value of ArmorPenetration in the default Pawn value scale is now 
	0.1, based on the latest information on WoWWiki.</li>
	<li>Includes VgerCore 1.0.1.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for items in the guild bank vault.</li>
	<li>In <i>some</i> cases, you can use mods that create fake item tooltips 
	like AtlasLoot and ItemSync along with mods that mangle item tooltips like 
	Rating Buster, and Pawn will now still work.&nbsp; No guarantees that your 
	favorite combination of mods won&#39;t break Pawn, but this should help a lot of 
	people out.</li>
	<li>Finally fixed that bug where items with both durability and an Equip: or 
	Use: line that Pawn didn&#39;t understand would get asterisks on the wrong 
	lines.&nbsp; (For example, Stalker&#39;s Helm of Second Sight has this problem.)</li>
	<li>Added the /pawn space command, which adds a blank space before the item 
	values it adds to tooltips.</li>
	<li>Added a special &quot;stat&quot; called SpeedBaseline.&nbsp; SpeedBaseline isn&#39;t an 
	actual item property, but rather a number to be subtracted from weapon 
	speeds before they&#39;re multiplied by your scale values.&nbsp; For example, if 
	you&#39;re an enhancement shaman who wants to give weapons 1 point for every 0.1 
	second of speed slower than 2.9, use Speed = 10 (1 / 0.1) and SpeedBaseline 
	= 2.9.&nbsp; Weapons slower than 2.9 would instead lose points at the same rate.</li>
	<li>Adjusted the value of the FeralAp stat in the Pawn default scale from 
	0.5 to 0.4 so that feral items in 2.3 will have roughly the same values as 
	they did in 2.2 with the old Pawn default scale and so that the Pawn default 
	scale still roughly mimics item budget formulas.&nbsp; I do not necessarily 
	recommend that you change values in your own scales; your items have been 
	buffed, so it makes sense for their values to go up.</li>
	<li>Weapon skill rating stats have been removed from Pawn and the default 
	Pawn scale, as they&#39;ve been removed from the game in the patch.&nbsp; 
	Existing scales will not be automatically updated to use ExpertiseRating.</li>
	<li>Added Pawn values to gems in the socketing UI.</li>
	<li>Fixed the amount of healing and spell damage received from Teardrop 
	Tourmaline and possibly other gems that previously only gave healing.</li>
	<li>Added support for the new Chaotic Skyfire Diamond.</li>
	<li>Now displays a more readable error message when the embedded mod 
	VgerCore is missing or failed to load.</li>
	<li>Fixed several problems introduced in 2.3:<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem that appeared in 2.3 due to the new way that set item 
	tooltips look where Pawn was putting asterisks all over the name of the set, 
	the items in the set, and the set bonuses.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem that appeared in 2.3 where stats on meta gems weren&#39;t 
	always being counted due to requirements now being displayed on gems even 
	when socketed.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug that appeared in 2.3 only where certain gems and random item 
	properties would appear very strange, such as &quot;+45 Stamina|cfff1a1a1a&quot;, and 
	Pawn would not understand them.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a script error that appeared the first time a recipe was clicked 
	since logging in or resetting your UI.</li>
	<li>Pawn now includes VgerCore 1.0 embedded within the mod; you don&#39;t need a 
	separate VgerCore folder in your AddOns folder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Supports the 2.2.x live realms and the 2.3 PTRs.&nbsp; 
	(Healing-to-spell-damage and expertise require 2.3, of course.)</li>
	<li>Support for the healing to spell damage conversion.&nbsp; Items that say 
	that they increase healing by 300 and spell damage by 100 will be reported 
	as Healing = 200, SpellPower = 100.&nbsp; Recall that SpellPower <i>includes</i> 
	healing, thus your scale&#39;s value for SpellPower should always be equal to or 
	greater than the value for Healing.</li>
	<li>A new value of .255 was picked for the value of Healing in the default 
	scale, down from .455.&nbsp; With this value, items that had 1/3 of their 
	Healing converted to SpellPower (default value .855) in 2.3 will have the exact 
	same values in 2.3 that they did with the old scale in 2.2 (ignoring rounding errors).&nbsp; Of 
	course, you can and should customize your Pawn scales to fit your needs; 
	generally, healers should <i>not </i>adjust their scales to deal with this 
	change.</li>
	<li>Support for the new ExpertiseRating stat, valued at 1 in the 
	default &quot;Pawn value&quot; scale, same as the existing weapon skill 
	stats.&nbsp; Existing scales will not be adjusted to include this stat.&nbsp; 
	If you haven&#39;t customized your scales and want to reset them, use /pawn resetscales.<ul>
		<li>Weapon skill ratings are currently still supported so you can use 
		Pawn 0.6.1 on the live realms too.&nbsp; They&#39;ll be removed in a later 
		version.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Support for many more healing enchantments, inscriptions, spellthread, 
	and so forth.</li>
	<li>Craftable items for which you can learn recipes from trainers will now 
	get Pawn values.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem introduced in beta 1 where Pawn would display 
	an error message in the chat window whenever hovering over a ring with 
	Enchant Ring - Weapon Might.</li>
	<li>Added the ability to customize the colors that your scales will use when 
	printed.&nbsp; For example, you could have your DPS value show up in orange, 
	and your healing value show up in green.&nbsp; This is an advanced feature 
	that probably will never get its own UI or slash command.&nbsp; See the 
	section titled &quot;Changing the color of a scale&quot; for more information.</li>
	<li>Importing a scale tag that has the exact same name as a scale you 
	already have will update the old scale to match the values in the scale tag.&nbsp; 
	All of the values in the old scale will be deleted.&nbsp; (In previous 
	versions, Pawn would just fail and warn you that you can&#39;t overwrite an 
	existing scale.&nbsp; There is no longer a warning.)</li>
	<li>Weapon stats have been overhauled!&nbsp; Old scales will work, but now 
	advanced users have a variety of new options for assigning values to 
	weapons.</li>
	<li>New stats: MeleeMinDamage, MeleeMaxDamage, MeleeSpeed, MeleeDps, 
	MainHandMinDamage, MainHandMaxDamage, MainHandSpeed, MainHandDps, 
	OffHandMinDamage, OffHandMaxDamage, OffHandSpeed, OffHandDps, 
	OneHandMinDamage, OneHandMaxDamage, OneHandSpeed, OneHandDps, 
	TwoHandMinDamage, TwoHandMaxDamage, TwoHandSpeed, TwoHandDps, 
	RangedMinDamage, RangedMaxDamage, RangedSpeed, RangedDps.&nbsp; Generally, 
	you&#39;ll only use a few of these, and not give values to all of them.</li>
	<li>New stats: MinDamage, MaxDamage, Speed.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t care about 
	which slot or weapon type it is, just use MinDamage, MaxDamage, Speed, 
	and/or Dps.&nbsp; Dps is now calculated to full precision (say, 41.333 
	instead of 41.3) instead of rounded to one decimal place.</li>
	<li>Added support for weapon damage enchantments (Striking and Impact).</li>
	<li>Added support for ranged weapon scopes.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where certain items with suffixes would show unusually low unenchanted
	values (their stats would be read as 0).  For example, Chimaerascale Legguards of the Bandit
	exhibited this problem.</li>
	<li>Added support for Black Morass instance-bound items (beacons).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for haste rating and spell haste rating, which were added as passive
	item bonuses on Black Temple equipment.  (Iron Counterweight is also supported.)  These two
	stats (HasteRating, SpellHasteRating) are valued at 1 each on the default Pawn scale; existing
	Pawn scales won't be affected.  Use /pawn resetscales to delete all of your scales and replace them
	with the default one.</li>
	<li>Added support for armor penetration ("Your attacks ignore X of your opponent's armor").
	This stat (ArmorPenetration) is not valued in the default Pawn scale.</li>
	<li>Added support for Karazhan, Stratholme, and Tempest Keep instance-bound items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for the new gold profession recipe links in WoW 2.1.&nbsp; 
	(Pawn won&#39;t try to read them or put asterisks all over them.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added working support for the Savagery weapon enchantment, and untested support
	for Potency, Soulfrost, and Sunfire.</li>
	<li>Added support for EquipCompare 2.10.&nbsp; (This may break compatibility 
	with older versions of EquipCompare; please use the latest version.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated for WoW patch 2.1.</li>
	<li>Added support for Blizzard&#39;s new Currently Equipped functionality 
	(shift-hover an item).</li>
	<li>LinkWrangler support.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where stats in certain situations (gems with multiple stats 
	on one gem, socket bonuses, etc.) wouldn&#39;t get shown in the /pawn debug on 
	output.&nbsp; This did not affect calculation; it was just a debug display error.</li>
	<li>Expanded the amount of information Pawn returns in the debug output.</li>
	<li>Added support for Enchant Boots: Vitality.</li>
	<li>Slightly updated a few of the default &quot;Pawn value&quot; scale&#39;s numbers.&nbsp; 
	This will not affect existing scales, even if you haven&#39;t changed any of the 
	defaults.&nbsp; If you want to get the new scale, you can wipe out your 
	existing scale(s) with /pawn resetscales.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Requires VgerCore 0.4.  (This is included with the mod.  Pawn will warn you if you
	are using an older version of VgerCore.)</li>
	<li>Pawn can now show unenchanted values for items in addition to the 
	regular enchanted values, and this is enabled by default.&nbsp; You can turn 
	it off with /pawn unenchanted off.&nbsp; This feature only works for real 
	tooltips, and not fake tooltips from an item database mod.</li>
	<li>Added an option to control the number of digits of precision Pawn uses 
	to display item values in tooltips.&nbsp; By default this is 1 (&quot;3.1&quot;), but 
	you can set it to any number between 0 (&quot;3&quot;) and 4 (&quot;3.1416&quot;) with /pawn 
	digits #.</li>
	<li>Corrected the value of frost resistance in the default Pawn scale to 1 
	(was 4).</li>
	<li>Pawn scale tags now have spaces inside of the parentheses by default.&nbsp; 
	This is to prevent certain scale tags from turning into emoticons when 
	posted to certain forums.&nbsp; (For example, if your scale tag ended in &quot;RedSocket=8)&quot;, 
	the 8) would turn into an emoticon on certain forums.)&nbsp; Old and current 
	versions of Pawn will accept the scale with or without the extra spaces. </li>
	<li>Lots of work was done to prepare for Pawn translations into other languages.&nbsp; 
	I may have made a mistake in this conversion and introduced cases where (*) 
	shows up where they didn&#39;t before; hopefully not.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.4.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for gun, bow, and crossbow skill ratings.</li>
	<li>Added support for MultiTips.</li>
	<li>Added support for items that list stats as &quot;Stat +X&quot; instead of &quot;+X 
	Stat&quot;, namely the epic gems.&nbsp; Gems that only provided primary stats, 
	such as Seer&#39;s Chrysoprase, already worked, but others such as Rune Covered 
	Chrysoprase didn&#39;t work until this change.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added scale tags!&nbsp; Scale tags are chunks of text that you can use 
	to share Pawn scales with friends, guildmates, and others on forums, similar 
	to how you can share talent specs today by passing around a link to the WoW 
	talent calculator.&nbsp; You can copy a scale tag and then post it on your 
	guild forums, and then another player can copy that tag and paste it into 
	their game to automatically add your scale to their copy of Pawn, without 
	logging out of the game or changing files in Notepad.&nbsp; To export a 
	scale tag so you can share it with others, use the /pawn export command.&nbsp; 
	To import someone else&#39;s scale tag and add it to your own scales, use the 
	/pawn import command.</li>
	<li>Added new slash commands: /pawn list, export, import, delete, and 
	rename.&nbsp; See &quot;Slash commands&quot; in Readme.htm for more details.</li>
	<li>Added support for weapon skill ratings (including unarmed and feral 
	combat).&nbsp; (They have been added to the default Pawn scale, but if you 
	care about weapon skill ratings you must add them to your custom scales 
	manually.)</li>
	<li>Fixed the /pawn resetscales command so that it would delete all of your 
	scales before recreating the default one named Pawn value, as was intended.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.3.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Hovering over an enchanted Item X immediately after hovering over an 
	unenchanted Item X will now recalculate the values for the second item 
	instead of just displaying the ones for the first item.&nbsp; This should 
	work for all pairs of items that differ only by enchantments and gems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>To read statistics, Pawn now makes a copy of the tooltip and reads from 
	that whenever possible, which allows it to read tooltips that have been 
	mangled by other mods.&nbsp; Examples of mods that do this are Mendeleev and 
	Rating Buster.&nbsp; (Certain mods that use custom tooltips, such as 
	ItemSync, don&#39;t support this; Pawn may still conflict with mods that modify 
	those custom tooltips.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.2.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ItemSync support, including using ItemSync with AtlasLoot.&nbsp; Pawn 
	will calculate and display values for ItemSync&#39;s tooltips.</li>
	<li>EQCompare support.&nbsp; Pawn will calculate and display values for 
	EQCompare&#39;s tooltips.</li>
	<li>Item level display should work just about everywhere now, instead of 
	just in certain places.&nbsp; (In previous versions, it worked for inventory 
	items, but not chat item links.&nbsp; Now it works on both.)</li>
	<li>A new option has been added to display the item ID for items you come 
	across, /pawn ids on.</li>
	<li>The default is now to hide the asterisks (*) from items that don&#39;t have 
	any values for any of your scales.&nbsp; So, for example, Hearthstone and 
	potions won&#39;t display the asterisk.&nbsp; You can change this behavior using 
	/pawn asterisks [ on | auto | off ].</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.2.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem in 0.2 where Pawn wouldn&#39;t work if you&#39;d never used 
	version 0.1 before.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>EquipCompare support.&nbsp; Pawn will calculate and display values for 
	EquipCompare&#39;s tooltips.</li>
	<li>AtlasLoot support.&nbsp; Pawn will calculate and display values for 
	instance drops when Atlas and AtlasLoot are installed.</li>
	<li>Outfitter support.&nbsp; Pawn will no longer conflict with the lines 
	that Outfitter adds to tooltips of items used in one or more gear sets.</li>
	<li>MonkeyQuest support.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t actually observed it happening in 
	the past, but this change should prevent MonkeyQuest&#39;s item tooltip 
	annotations from affecting Pawn.</li>
	<li>MobInfo-2 support.&nbsp; Pawn will no longer conflict with the drop rate 
	information that MobInfo-2 adds to items.&nbsp; (This problem manifested 
	itself both as unnecessary asterisks added to tooltips, and also as an 
	&quot;attempted to concatenate a nil value&quot; error.)</li>
	<li>Added APIs to create and change Pawn scales while you&#39;re still logged 
	in.&nbsp; These will eventually be used to build a configuration UI.&nbsp; 
	If you <i>really</i> want to, you can use them from the chat box to change 
	Pawn scales while logged into the game.</li>
	<li>Included a new file "Sample scales.htm" containing (you guessed it) some
	sample scales that you can use to get started creating your own.  I'll add to this
	over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The first released beta version of Pawn.&nbsp; The code is stable and 
	the remaining bugs are mostly just to-do items.&nbsp; I&#39;ll get around to 
	them eventually.</li>
	<li>Not heavily optimized for performance.</li>
	<li>No configuration UI.&nbsp; (Hope you like Notepad!)</li>
</ul>
